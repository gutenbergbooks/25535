<h4>MONTAIGNE AND SHAKSPERE</h4>


<p>For a good many years past the anatomic
study of Shakspere, of which a revival seems
now on foot, has been somewhat out of fashion,
as compared with its vogue in the palmy days
of the New Shakspere Society in England,
and the years of the battle between the iconoclasts
and the worshippers in Germany. When
Mr. Fleay and Mr. Spedding were hard at work
on the metrical tests; when Mr. Spedding
was subtly undoing the chronological psychology
of Dr. Furnivall; when the latter
student was on his part undoing in quite
another style some of the judgments of
Mr. Swinburne; and when Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps
was with natural wrath calling
on Mr. Browning, as President of the
Society, to keep Dr. Furnivall in order, we
(then) younger onlookers felt that literary history
was verily being made. Our sensations, it
seemed, might be as those of our elders had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
been over Mr. Collier's emendated folio, and the
tragical end thereof. Then came a period of lull
in things Shaksperean, partly to be accounted
for by the protrusion of the Browning Society
and kindred undertakings. It seemed as if
once more men had come to the attitude of 1850,
when Mr. Phillipps had written: "An opinion
has been gaining ground, and has been
encouraged by writers whose judgment is
entitled to respectful consideration, that almost
if not all the commentary on the works of
Shakspere of a necessary and desirable kind
has already been given to the world."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> And,
indeed, so much need was there for time to
digest the new criticism that it may be doubted
whether among the general cultured public the
process is even now accomplished.</p>

<p>To this literary phase in particular, and to
our occupation with other studies in general,
may be attributed the opportunity which still
exists for the discussion of one of the most interesting
of all problems concerning Shakspere.
Mr. Browning, Mr. Meredith, Ibsen, Tolstoi&mdash;a
host of peculiarly modern problem-makers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>have been exorcising our not inexhaustible taste
for the problematic, so that there was no very
violent excitement over even the series of new
"Keys" to the sonnets which came forth in the
lull of the analysis of the plays; and yet, even
with all the problems of modernity in view, it
seems as if it must be rather by accident of
oversight than for lack of interest in new
developments of Shakspere-study that so little
attention has been given among us to a question
which, once raised, has a very peculiar literary
and psychological attraction of its own&mdash;the
subject, namely, of the influence which the plays
show their author to have undergone from the
Essays of Montaigne.</p>

<p>As to the bare fact of the influence, there can
be little question. That Shakspere in one
scene in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span> versifies a passage from the
prose of Florio's translation of Montaigne's
chapter <span class="smcap">Of the Cannibals</span> has been recognised
by all the commentators since Capell (1767), who
detected the transcript from a reading of the
French only, not having compared the translation.
The first thought of students was to
connect the passage with Ben Johnson's allusion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
in <span class="smcap">Volpone</span><a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> to frequent "stealings from Montaigne"
by contemporary writers; and though
<span class="smcap">Volpone</span> dates from 1605, and the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span> from
1610-1613, there has been no systematic attempt
to apply the clue chronologically. Still, it has
been recognised or surmised by a series of
writers that the influence of the essayist on the
dramatist went further than the passage in question.
John Sterling, writing on Montaigne in
1838 (when Sir Frederick Madden's pamphlet
on the autograph of Shakspere in a copy of
Florio had called special attention to the
Essays), remarked that "on the whole, the celebrated
soliloquy in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> presents a more
characteristic and expressive resemblance to
much of Montaigne's writings than any other
portion of the plays of the great dramatist which
we at present remember"; and further threw
out the germ of a thesis which has since been
disastrously developed, to the effect that "the
Prince of Denmark is very nearly a Montaigne,
lifted to a higher eminence, and agitated by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>more striking circumstances and a severer
destiny, and altogether a somewhat more passionate
structure of man."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> In 1846, again,
Philar&egrave;te Chasles, an acute and original critic,
citing the passage in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>, went on to
declare that "once on the track of the studies
and tastes of Shakspere, we find Montaigne at
every corner, in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, in <span class="smcap">Othello</span>, in <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>.
Even the composite style of Shakspere,
so animated, so vivid, so new, so incisive, so
coloured, so hardy, offers a multitude of striking
analogies to the admirable and free manner of
Montaigne."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The suggestion as to the "To be
or not to be" soliloquy has been taken up by
some critics, but rejected by others; and the propositions
of M. Chasles, so far as I am aware,
have never been supported by evidence. Nevertheless,
the general fact of a frequent reproduction
or manipulation of Montaigne's ideas in
some of Shakspere's later plays has, I think,
since been established.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago I incidentally cited, in an
essay on the composition of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, some dozen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>of the Essays of Montaigne from which Shakspere
had apparently received suggestions, and
instanced one or two cases in which actual peculiarities
of phrase in Florio's translation of the
Essays are adopted by him, in addition to a peculiar
coincidence which has been pointed out by
Mr. Jacob Feis in his work entitled <span class="smcap">Shakspere
and Montaigne</span>; and since then the late Mr.
Henry Morley, in his edition of the Florio translation,
has pointed to a still more remarkable
coincidence of phrase, in a passage of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>
which I had traced to Montaigne without noticing
the decisive verbal agreement in question. Yet
so far as I have seen, the matter has passed for
little more than a literary curiosity, arousing
no new ideas as to Shakspere's mental development.
The notable suggestion of Chasles on
that head has been ignored more completely
than the theory of Mr. Feis, which in comparison
is merely fantastic. Either, then, there is an
unwillingness in England to conceive of Shakspere
as owing much to foreign influences, or
as a case of intelligible mental growth, or else
the whole critical problem which Shakspere
represents&mdash;and he may be regarded as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
greatest of critical problems&mdash;comes within the
general disregard for serious criticism, noticeable
among us of late years. And the work of
Mr. Feis, unfortunately, is as a whole so
extravagant that it could hardly fail to bring a
special suspicion on every form of the theory of
an intellectual tie between Shakspere and Montaigne.
Not only does he undertake to show in
dead earnest what Sterling had vaguely suggested
as conceivable, that Shakspere meant
Hamlet to represent Montaigne, but he strenuously
argues that the poet framed the play in
order to discredit Montaigne's opinions&mdash;a thesis
which almost makes the Bacon theory specious
by comparison. Naturally it has made no converts,
even in Germany, where, as it happens, it
had been anticipated.</p>

<p>In France, however, the neglect of the special
problem of Montaigne's influence on Shakspere
is less easily to be explained, seeing how much
intelligent study has been given of late by
French critics to both Shakspere and Montaigne.
The influence is recognised; but here
again it is only cursorily traced. The latest
study of Montaigne is that of M. Paul Stapfer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
a vigilant critic, whose services to Shakspere-study
have been recognised in both countries.
But all that M. Stapfer claims for the influence
of the French essayist on the English dramatist
is thus put:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Montaigne is perhaps too purely French to have
exercised much influence abroad. Nevertheless his
influence on England is not to be disdained. Shakspere
appreciated him (<i>le go&ucirc;tait</i>); he has inserted in
the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span> a passage of the chapter <span class="smcap">Des Cannibales</span>;
and the strong expressions of the <span class="smcap">Essays</span> on man, the
inconstant, irresolute being, contrary to himself, marvellously
vain, various and changeful, were perhaps not
unconnected with (<i>peut &ecirc;tre pas &eacute;trang&egrave;res &agrave;</i>) the conception
of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>. The author of the scene of the grave-diggers
must have felt the savour and retained the impression
of this thought, humid and cold as the grave:
'The heart and the life of a great and triumphant
emperor are but the repast of a little worm.' The translation
of Plutarch, or rather of Amyot, by Thomas
North, and that of Montaigne by Florio, had together
a great and long vogue in the English society of the
seventeenth century."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p></div>

<p>So modest a claim, coming from the French
side, can hardly be blamed on the score of that
very modesty. It is the fact, however, that,
though M. Stapfer has in another work<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>pared
Shakspere with a French classic
critically enough, he has here understated his
case. He was led to such an attitude in his
earlier study of Shakspere by the slightness of
the evidence offered for the claim of M. Chasles,
of which he wrote that it is "a gratuitous supposition,
quite unjustified by the few traces in his
writings of his having read the Essays."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> But
that verdict was passed without due scrutiny.
The influence of Montaigne on Shakspere was
both wider and deeper than M. Stapfer has suggested;
and it is perhaps more fitting, after all,
that the proof should be undertaken by some of
us who, speaking Shakspere's tongue, cannot
well be suspected of seeking to belittle him when
we trace the sources for his thought, whether in
his life or in his culture. There is still, indeed,
a tendency among the more primitively patriotic
to look jealously at such inquiries, as tending to
diminish the glory of the worshipped name;
but for anyone who is capable of appreciating
Shakspere's greatness, there can be no question
of iconoclasm in the matter. Shakspere ignorantly
adored is a mere dubious mystery; Shaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>pere
followed up and comprehended, step by
step, albeit never wholly revealed, becomes more
remarkable, more profoundly interesting, as he
becomes more intelligible. We are embarked,
not on a quest for plagiarisms, but on a study of
the growth of a wonderful mind. And in the
idea that much of the growth is traceable to the
fertilising contact of a foreign intelligence there
can be nothing but interest and attraction for
those who have mastered the primary sociological
truth that such contacts of cultures are
the very life of civilisation.

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>


<h3>II.</h3>


<p>The first requirement in the study, obviously,
is an exact statement of the coincidences of
phrase and thought in Shakspere and Montaigne.
Not that such coincidences are the main
or the only results to be looked for; rather we
may reasonably expect to find Shakspere's
thought often diverging at a tangent from that
of the writer he is reading, or even directly gainsaying
it. But there can be no solid argument
as to such indirect influence until we have fully
established the direct influence, and this can
only be done by exhibiting a considerable number
of coincidences. M. Chasles, while avowing
that "the comparison of texts is indispensable&mdash;we
must undergo this fatigue in order to know
to what extent Shakspere, between 1603 and
1615, became familiar with Montaigne"&mdash;strangely
enough made no comparison of texts
whatever beyond reproducing the familiar paraphrase
in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>, from the essay <span class="smcap">Of
Cannibals</span>; and left absolutely unsupported his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
assertion as to <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, <span class="smcap">Othello</span>, and <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>.
It is necessary to produce proofs, and to
look narrowly to dates. Florio's translation,
though licensed in 1601, was not published till
1603, the year of the piratical publication of the
First Quarto of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, in which the play lacks
much of its present matter, and shows in many
parts so little trace of Shakspere's spirit and
versification that, even if we hold the text to
have been imperfectly taken down in shorthand,
as it no doubt was, we cannot suppose him to
have at this stage completed his refashioning
of the older play, which is undoubtedly the substratum
of his.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> We must therefore keep
closely in view the divergencies between this
text and that of the Second Quarto, printed in
1604, in which the transmuting touch of Shakspere
is broadly evident. It is quite possible
that Shakspere may have seen parts of Florio's
translation before 1603, or heard passages from
it read; or even that he might have read Montaigne
in the original. But as his possession of
the translation is made certain by the preserva<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>tion
of the copy bearing his autograph, and as
it is from Florio that he is seen to have copied
in the passages where his copying is beyond dispute,
it is on Florio's translation that we must
proceed.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>I. In order to keep all the evidence in view,
we may first of all collate once more the passage
in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span> with that in the Essays which it
unquestionably follows. In Florio's translation,
Montaigne's words run:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They [Lycurgus and Plato] could not imagine a
genuity so pure and simple, as we see it by experience,
nor ever believe our society might be maintained with
so little art and human combination. It is a nation
(would I answer Plato) that hath no kind of traffic, no
knowledge of letters, no intelligence of numbers, no
name of magistrate, nor of politic superiority; no use
of service, of riches, or of poverty; no contracts, no
successions, no dividences, no occupations, but idle; no
respect of kindred, but common; no apparel, but
natural; no manuring of lands, no use of wine, corn,
or metal. The very words that import lying, falsehood,
treason, dissimulation, covetousness, envy, detraction,
and passion, were never heard of amongst them. How
dissonant would he find his imaginary commonwealth
from this perfection?"</p></div>

<p>Compare the speech in which the kind old
Gonzalo seeks to divert the troubled mind of the
shipwrecked King Alonso:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries</span>
<span class="i0">Execute all things: for no kind of traffic</span>
<span class="i0">Would I admit; no name of magistrate;</span>
<span class="i0">Letters should not be known; no use of service,</span>
<span class="i0">Of riches, or of poverty; no contracts,</span>
<span class="i0">Succession; bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none:</span>
<span class="i0">No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil:</span>
<span class="i0">No occupation, all men idle, all;</span>
<span class="i0">And women too: but innocent and pure:</span>
<span class="i0">No sovereignty...."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>There can be no dispute as to the direct transcription
here, where the dramatist is but incidentally
playing with Montaigne's idea, proceeding
to put some gibes at it in the mouths of
Gonzalo's rascally comrades; and it follows that
Gonzalo's further phrase, "to excel the golden
age," proceeds from Montaigne's previous
words: "exceed all the pictures wherewith
licentious poesy hath proudly embellished the
golden age." The play was in all probability
written in or before 1610. It remains to show
that on his first reading of Florio's Montaigne,
in 1603-4, Shakspere was more deeply and
widely influenced, though the specific proofs are
in the nature of the case less palpable.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>II. Let us take first the more decisive coincidences
of phrase. Correspondences of thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
which in themselves do not establish their direct
connection, have a new significance when it is
seen that other coincidences amount to manifest
reproduction. And such a coincidence we have,
to begin with, in the familiar lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</span>
<span class="i0">Rough-hew them how we will."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>I pointed out in 1885 that this expression, which
does not occur in the First Quarto <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, corresponds
very closely with the theme of Montaigne's
essay, <span class="smcap">THAT FORTUNE IS OFTENTIMES MET
WITHALL IN PURSUIT OF REASON</span>,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> in which occurs
the phrase, "Fortune has more judgment<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> than
we," a translation from Menander. But Professor
Morley, having had his attention called to
the subject by the work of Mr. Feis, who had
suggested another passage as the source of
Shakspere's, made a more perfect identification.
Reading the proofs of the Florio translation for
his reprint, he found, what I had not observed
in my occasional access to the old folio, not then
reprinted, that the very metaphor of "rough-hewing"
occurs in Florio's rendering of a pas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>sage
in the Essays:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> "My consultation doth
somewhat roughly hew the matter, and by its first
shew lightly consider the same: the main and
chief point of the work I am wont to resign to
Heaven." This is a much more exact coincidence
than is presented in the passage cited by
Mr. Feis from the essay <span class="smcap">Of Physiognomy</span>:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
"Therefore do our designs so often miscarry....
The heavens are angry, and
I may say envious of the extension and
large privilege we ascribe to human wisdom,
to the prejudice of theirs, and abridge
them so much more unto us by so much more we
endeavour to amplify them." If there were no
closer parallel than that in Montaigne, we should
be bound to take it as an expansion of a phrase
in Seneca's <span class="smcap">Agamemnon</span>,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> which was likely to
have become proverbial. I may add that the
thought is often repeated in the Essays, and that
in several passages it compares notably with
Shakspere's lines. These begin:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Rashly,</span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And praised be rashness for it&mdash;Let us know</span>
<span class="i0">Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
<span class="i0">When our deep plots do pall; and that should learn us</span>
<span class="i0">There's a divinity" etc.</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Compare the following extracts from Florio's
translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The <i>D&aelig;mon</i> of Socrates were peradventure a certain
inpulsion or will which without the advice of his discourse
presented itself unto him. In a mind so well
purified, and by continual exercise of wisdom and virtue
so well prepared as his was, it is likely his inclinations
(though rash and inconsiderate) were ever of great
moment, and worthy to be followed. Every man
feeleth in himself some image of such agitations, of a
prompt, vehement, and casual opinion. It is in me to
give them some authority, that afford so little to our
wisdom. And I have had some (equally weak in reason
and violent in persuasion and dissuasion, which was
more ordinary to Socrates) by which I have so happily
and so profitably suffered myself to be transported, as
they might perhaps be thought to contain some matter
of divine inspiration."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>"Even in our counsels and deliberations, some chance
or good luck must needs be joined to them; for whatsoever
our wisdom can effect is no great matter."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>"When I consider the most glorious exploits of war,
methinks I see that those who have had the conduct
of them employ neither counsel nor deliberation about
them, but for fashion sake, and leave the best part of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>the enterprise to fortune; and on the confidence they
have in her aid, they still go beyond the limits of all
discourse. Casual rejoicings and strange furies ensue
among their deliberations."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> etc.</p></div>

<p>Compare finally Florio's translation of the
lines of Manilius cited by Montaigne at the end
of the 47th Essay of the First Book:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"'Tis best for ill-advis'd, wisdom may fail,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fortune proves not the cause that should prevail,</span>
<span class="i0">But here and there without respect doth sail:</span>
<span class="i0">A higher power forsooth us overdraws,</span>
<span class="i0">And mortal states guides with immortal laws."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is to be remembered, indeed, that the idea
expressed in Hamlet's words to Horatio is partly
anticipated in the rhymed speech of the Player-King
in the play-scene in Act III., which occurs
in the First Quarto:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Our wills, our fates do so contrary run</span>
<span class="i0">That our devices still are overthrown;</span>
<span class="i0">Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own."</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>Such a passage, reiterating a familiar commonplace,
might seem at first sight to tell against
the view that Hamlet's later speech to Horatio
is an echo of Montaigne. But that view being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>found justified by the evidence, and the idea in
that passage being exactly coincident with Montaigne's,
while the above lines are only partially
parallel in meaning, we are forced to admit that
Shakspere may have been influenced by Montaigne
even where a partial precedent might be
found in his own or other English work.</p>

<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>III. The phrase "discourse of reason," which
is spoken by Hamlet in his first soliloquy,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and
which first appears in the Second Quarto, is not
used by Shakspere in any play before <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>;
and he uses it again in <span class="smcap">Troilus and Cressida</span>;<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
while "discourse of thought" appears in
<span class="smcap">Othello</span>;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and "discourse," in the sense of
reasoning faculty, is used in Hamlet's last soliloquy.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
In English literature this use of the
word seems to be special in Shakspere's period,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
and it has been noted by an admirer as a finely
Shaksperean expression. But the expression
"discourse of reason" occurs at least four times
in Montaigne's Essays, and in Florio's translation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of them: in the essay<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> <span class="smcap">That to philosophise
is to learn how to die</span>; again at the close
of the essay<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> <i>A demain les affaires</i>; again in the
first paragraph of the <span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond
Sebonde</span><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>; and yet again in the chapter on <span class="smcap">The
History of Spurina</span>;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> and though it seems to
be scholastic in origin, and occurs once or twice
before 1600 in English books, it is difficult to
doubt that, like the other phrase above cited, it
came to Shakspere through Florio's Montaigne.
The word <i>discours</i> is a hundred times used
singly by Montaigne, as by Shakspere in the
phrase "of such large discourse," for the process
of ratiocination.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>IV. Then again there is the clue of Skakspere's
use of the word "consummation" in the
revised form of the "To be" soliloquy. This,
as Mr. Feis pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> is the word used by
Florio as a rendering of <i>an&eacute;antissement</i> in the
speech of Socrates as given by Montaigne in the
essay<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> <span class="smcap">Of Physiognomy</span>. Shakspere makes
Hamlet speak of annihilation as "a consumma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>tion
devoutly to be wished." Florio has: "If
it (death) be a consummation of one's being, it
is also an amendment and entrance into a long
and quiet night. We find nothing so sweet in
life as a quiet and gentle sleep, and without
dreams." Here not only do the words coincide
in a peculiar way, but the idea in the two
phrases is the same; the theme of sleep and
dreams being further common to the two
writings.</p>

<p>Beyond these, I have not noted any correspondences
of phrase so precise as to prove
reminiscence beyond possibility of dispute; but
it is not difficult to trace striking correspondences
which, though falling short of explicit reproduction,
inevitably suggest a relation; and
these it now behoves us to consider. The remarkable
thing is, as regards <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, that they
almost all occur in passages not present in the
First Quarto.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>V. When we compare part of the speech of
Rosencrantz on sedition<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> with a passage in Montaigne's
essay, <span class="smcap">Of Custom</span>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> we find a somewhat
close coincidence. In the play Rosencrantz
says:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"The cease of Majesty,</span>
<span class="i_0">Dies not alone; but like a gulf doth draw</span>
<span class="i_0">What's near with it: it is a massy wheel</span>
<span class="i_0">Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,</span>
<span class="i_0">To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things</span>
<span class="i_0">Are mortised and adjoined; which, when it falls,</span>
<span class="i_0">Each small annexment, petty consequence,</span>
<span class="i_0">Attends the boisterous ruin."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Florio has:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Those who attempt to shake an Estate are commonly
the first overthrown by the fall of it.... The
contexture and combining of this monarchy and great
building having been dismissed and dissolved by it,
namely, in her old years, giveth as much overture and
entrance as a man will to like injuries. Royal <i>majesty</i>
doth more hardly fall from the top to the middle, than
it tumbleth down from the middle to the bottom."</p></div>

<p>The verbal correspondence here is only less
decisive&mdash;as regards the use of the word
"majesty"&mdash;than in the passages collated by
Mr. Morley; while the thought corresponds as
closely.</p>

<p>VI. The speech of Hamlet,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> "There is
nothing either good or bad but thinking makes
it so"; and Iago's "'tis in ourselves that we are
thus or thus,"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> are expressions of a favourite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>thesis of Montaigne's, to which he devotes an
entire essay.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The Shaksperean phrases echo
closely such sentences as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If that which we call evil and torment be neither
torment nor evil, but that our fancy only gives it that
quality, it is in us to change it.... That which
we term evil is not so of itself."... "Every man
is either well or ill according as he finds himself."</p></div>

<p>And in the essay<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> <span class="smcap">Of Democritus and Heraclitus</span>
there is another close parallel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Therefore let us take no more excuses from external
qualities of things. To us it belongeth to give ourselves
account of it. Our good and our evil hath no
dependency but from ourselves."</p></div>

<p>VII. Hamlet's apostrophe to his mother on
the power of custom&mdash;a passage which, like the
others above cited, first appears in the Second
Quarto&mdash;is similarly an echo of a favourite
proposition of Montaigne, who devotes to it the
essay<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> <span class="smcap">Of Custom, and not to change readily a
received law</span>. In that there occur the typical
passages:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Custom doth so blear us that we cannot distinguish
the usage of things.... Certes, chastity is an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>cellent
virtue, the commodity whereof is very well
known; but to use it, and according to nature to
prevail with it, is as hard as it is easy to endear it and
to prevail with it according to custom, to laws and precepts."
"The laws of conscience, which we say are
born of nature, are born of custom."</p></div>

<p>Again, in the essay <span class="smcap">Of Controlling one's Will</span><a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
we have: "Custom is a second nature, and not
less potent."</p>

<p>Hamlet's words are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat</span>
<span class="i0">Of habits devil, is angel yet in this</span>
<span class="i0">That to the use of actions fair and good</span>
<span class="i0">He likewise gives a frock or livery</span>
<span class="i0">That aptly is put on....</span>
<span class="i0">For use can almost change the stamp of nature."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>No doubt the idea is a classic commonplace; and
in the early <span class="smcap">Two Gentlemen of Verona</span><a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> we
actually have the line, "How use doth breed a
habit in a man;" but here again there seems
reason to regard Montaigne as having suggested
Shakspere's vivid and many-coloured wording of
the idea in the tragedy. Indeed, even the line
cited from the early comedy may have been one
of the poet's many later additions to his text.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>
<p>VIII. A less close but still a noteworthy resemblance
is that between the passage in which
Hamlet expresses to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
the veering of his mood from joy in things
to disgust with them, and the paragraph in the
<span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond Sebonde</span> in which Montaigne
sets against each other the splendour of
the universe and the littleness of man. Here
the thought diverges, Shakspere making it his
own as he always does, and altering its aim;
but the language is curiously similar. Hamlet
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It goes so heavily with my disposition that this
goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory:
this most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this
brave o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof,
fretted with golden fire, why it appears no other thing
to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is man! How noble in reason!
how infinite in faculties! in form and moving, how
express and admirable! in action, how like an angel!
in apprehension, how like a God! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet to me what
is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me."</p></div>

<p>Montaigne, as translated by Florio, has:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Let us see what hold-fast or free-hold he (man) hath
in this gorgeous and goodly equipage.... Who
hath persuaded him, that this admirable moving of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>heaven's vaults, that the eternal light of these lamps
so fiercely rolling over his head ... were established
... for his commodity and service? Is it
possible to imagine anything so ridiculous as this
miserable and wretched creature, which is not so much
as master of himself, exposed and subject to offences
of all things, and yet dareth call himself Master and
Emperor of this universe?... [To consider ...
the power and domination these (celestial) bodies have,
not only upon our lives and conditions of our fortune
... but also over our dispositions and inclinations,
our discourses and wills, which they rule, provoke,
and move at the pleasure of their influences.]...
Of all creatures man is the most miserable and frail,
and therewithal the proudest and disdainfullest. Who
perceiveth himself placed here, amidst the filth and
mire of the world ... and yet dareth imaginarily
place himself above the circle of the Moon, and reduce
heaven under his feet. It is through the vanity of the
same imagination that he dare equal himself to God."</p></div>

<p>The passage in brackets is left here in its place,
not as suggesting anything in Hamlet's speech,
but as paralleling a line in <span class="smcap">Measure for
Measure</span>, to be dealt with immediately. But
it will be seen that the rest of the passage, though
turned to quite another purpose than Hamlet's,
brings together in the same way a set of contrasted
ideas of human greatness and smallness,
and of the splendour of the midnight firmament.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
IX. The nervous protest of Hamlet to
Horatio on the point of the national vice of
drunkenness,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> of which all save the beginning
is added in the Second Quarto just before the
entrance of the Ghost, has several curious points
of coincidence with Montaigne's essay<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> on <span class="smcap">The
History of Spurina</span>, which discusses at great
length a matter of special interest to Shakspere&mdash;the
character of Julius C&aelig;sar. In the course
of the examination Montaigne takes trouble to
show that Cato's use of the epithet "drunkard"
to C&aelig;sar could not have been meant literally;
that the same Cato admitted C&aelig;sar's sobriety in
the matter of drinking. It is after making light
of C&aelig;sar's faults in other matters of personal
conduct that the essayist comes to this decision:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"But all these noble inclinations, rich gifts, worthy
qualities, were altered, smothered, and eclipsed by this
furious passion of ambition.... To conclude, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>only vice (in mine opinion) lost and overthrew in him
the fairest natural and richest ingenuity that ever was,
and hath made his memory abominable to all honest
minds."</p></div>

<p>Compare the exquisitely high-strung lines, so
congruous in their excited rapidity with Hamlet's
intensity of expectation, which follow on
his notable outburst on the subject of drunkenness:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"So oft it chances in particular men,</span>
<span class="i0">That for some vicious mode of nature in them,</span>
<span class="i0">As in their birth (wherein they are not guilty,</span>
<span class="i0">Since nature cannot choose its origin),</span>
<span class="i0">By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,</span>
<span class="i0">Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason;</span>
<span class="i0">Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens</span>
<span class="i0">The form of plausive manners; that these men,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect;</span>
<span class="i0">Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Their virtues else (be they as pure as grace,</span>
<span class="i0">As infinite as man may undergo)</span>
<span class="i0">Shall in the general censure take corruption</span>
<span class="i0">From that particular fault...."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Even the idea that "nature cannot choose its
origin" is suggested by the context in Montaigne.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
Shakspere's estimate of C&aelig;sar, of
course, diverged from that of the essay.</p>

<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>X. I find a certain singularity of coincidence
between the words of King Claudius on kingship:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"There's such divinity doth hedge a king,</span>
<span class="i0">That treason can but peep to what it would,</span>
<span class="i0">Acts little of his will,"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>and a passage in the essay<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> <span class="smcap">Of the Incommodity
of Greatness</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To be a king, is a matter of that consequence, that
only by it he is so. That strange glimmering and eye-dazzling
light, which round about environeth, over-casteth
and hideth from us: our weak sight is thereby
bleared and dissipated, as being filled and obscured by
that greater and further-spreading brightness."</p></div>

<p>The working out of the metaphor here gives at
once to Shakspere's terms "divinity" and "can
but peep" a point not otherwise easily seen; but
the idea of a dazzling light may be really what
was meant in the play; and one is tempted to
pronounce the passage a reminiscence of Montaigne.
Here, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>however, it has to be noted that
in the First Quarto we have the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"There's such divinity doth wall a king</span>
<span class="i0">That treason dares not look on."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>And if Shakspere had not seen or heard the
passage in Montaigne before the publication of
Florio's folio&mdash;which, however, he may very well
have done&mdash;the theory of reminiscence here cannot
stand.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XI. In Hamlet's soliloquy on the passage of
the army of Fortinbras&mdash;one of the many passages
added in the Second Quarto&mdash;there is a
strong general resemblance to a passage in the
essay <span class="smcap">Of Diversion</span>.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Hamlet first remarks to
the Captain:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats</span>
<span class="i0">Will not debate the question of this straw:</span>
<span class="i0">This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace;"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>and afterwards soliloquises:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Examples gross as earth exhort me:</span>
<span class="i0">Witness, this army of such mass and charge,</span>
<span class="i0">Led by a delicate and tender prince,</span>
<span class="i0">Whose spirit, by divine ambition puff'd,</span>
<span class="i0">Makes mouths at the invisible event;</span>
<span class="i0">Exposing what is mortal and unsure</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
<span class="i0">To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,</span>
<span class="i0">Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great,</span>
<span class="i0">Is not to stir without great argument,</span>
<span class="i0">But greatly to find quarrel in a straw.</span>
<span class="i0">When honour is at stake....</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7_5">....to my shame I see</span>
<span class="i0">The imminent death of twenty thousand men,</span>
<span class="i0">That for a fantasy and trick of fame,</span>
<span class="i0">Go to their graves like beds; fight for a plot</span>
<span class="i0">Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause...."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Montaigne has the same general idea in the
essay <span class="smcap">Of Diversion</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"If one demand that fellow, what interest he hath in
such a siege: The interest of example (he will say) and
common obedience of the Prince: I nor look nor pretend
any benefit thereby ... I have neither passion
nor quarrel in the matter. Yet the next day you will
see him all changed, and chafing, boiling and blushing
with rage, in his rank of battle, ready for the assault.
It is the glaring reflecting of so much steel, the flashing
thundering of the cannon, the clang of trumpets, and
the rattling of drums, that have infused this new fury
and rancour in his swelling veins. A frivolous cause,
will you say? How a cause? There needeth none to
excite our mind. A doting humour without body, without
substance, overswayeth it up and down."</p></div>

<p>The thought recurs in the essay, <span class="smcap">Of Controlling
one's Will</span>.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>"Our greatest agitations have strange springs and
ridiculous causes. What ruin did our last Duke of
Burgundy run into, for the quarrel of a cart-load of
sheep-skins?... See why that man doth hazard
both his honour and life on the fortune of his rapier
and dagger; let him tell you whence the cause of that
confusion ariseth, he cannot without blushing; so vain
and frivolous is the occasion."</p></div>

<p>And the idea in Hamlet's lines "rightly to be
great," etc., is suggested in the essay <span class="smcap">Of Repenting</span>,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
where we have:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The nearest way to come unto glory were to do that
for conscience which we do for glory.... The worth
of the mind consisteth not in going high, but in going
orderly. Her greatness is not exercised in greatness;
in mediocrity it is."</p></div>

<p>In the essay <span class="smcap">Of Experience</span><a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> there is a sentence
partially expressing the same thought,
which is cited by Mr. Feis as a reproduction:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The greatness of the mind is not so much to draw
up, and hale forward, as to know how to range, direct,
and circumscribe itself. It holdeth for great what is
sufficient, and sheweth her height in loving mean things
better than eminent."</p></div>

<p>Here, certainly, as in the previous citation, the
idea is not identical with that expressed by
Hamlet. But the elements he combines are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>there; and again, in the essay <span class="smcap">Of Solitariness</span><a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
we have the picture of the soldier fighting furiously
for the quarrel of his careless king, with
the question: "Who doth not willingly chop
and counter-change his health, his ease, yea
his life, for glory and reputation, the most unprofitable,
vain, and counterfeit coin that is in
use with us."</p>

<p>And yet again the thought crops up in the
<span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond Sebonde</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This horror-causing array of so many thousands of
armed men, so great fury, earnest fervour, and undaunted
courage, it would make one laugh to see on
how many vain occasions it is raised and set on fire....
The hatred of one man, a spite, a pleasure ...
causes which ought not to move two scolding
fishwives to catch one another, is the soul and motive
of all this hurly-burly."</p></div>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XII. Yet one more of Hamlet's sayings peculiar
to the revised form of the play seems to be an
echo of a thought of Montaigne's. At the outset
of the soliloquy last quoted from, Hamlet
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"What is a man</span>
<span class="i0">If his chief good and market of his time,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
<span class="i0">Be but to sleep and feed? A beast; no more.</span>
<span class="i0">Sure He that made us with such large discourse,</span>
<span class="i0">Looking before and after, gave us not</span>
<span class="i0">That capability and godlike reason</span>
<span class="i0">To fust in us unused."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The bearing of the thought in the soliloquy,
where Hamlet spasmodically applies it to the
stimulation of his vengeance, is certainly never
given to it by Montaigne, who has left on
record<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> his small approbation of revenge; but
the thought itself is there, in the essay<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
<span class="smcap">On Goods and Evils</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Shall we employ the intelligence Heaven hath
bestowed upon us for our greatest good, to our ruin,
repugning nature's design and the universal order and
vicissitude of things, which implieth that every man
should use his instrument and means for his own commodity?"</p></div>

<p>Again, there is a passage in the essay <span class="smcap">Of the
Affection of Fathers to their Children</span>,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
where there occurs a specific coincidence of
phrase, the special use of the term "discourse,"
which we have already traced from Shakspere to
Montaigne; and where at the same time the contrast
between man and beast is drawn, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>not to the same purpose as in the speech of
Hamlet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Since it hath pleased God to endow us with some
capacity of discourse, that as beasts we should not servilely
be subjected to common laws, but rather with
judgment and voluntary liberty apply ourselves unto
them, we ought somewhat to yield unto the simple
authority of Nature, but not suffer her tyrannically to
carry us away; only reason ought to have the conduct
of our inclinations."</p></div>

<p>Finally we have a third parallel, with a slight
coincidence of terms, in the essay<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> <span class="smcap">Of Giving
the lie</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nature hath endowed us with a large faculty to
entertain ourselves apart, and often calleth us unto
it, to teach us that partly we owe ourselves unto
society, but in the better part unto ourselves."</p></div>

<p>It may be argued that these, like one or two
of the other sayings above cited as echoed by
Shakspere from Montaigne, are of the nature
of general religious or ethical maxims, traceable
to no one source; and if we only found one or
two such parallels, their resemblance of course
would have no evidential value, save as regards
coincidence of terms. For this very passage, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>instance, there is a classic original, or at least a
familiar source, in Cicero,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> where the commonplace
of the contrast between man and beast is
drawn in terms that come in a general way
pretty close to Hamlet's. This treatise of
Cicero was available to Shakspere in several
English translations;<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> and only the fact that
we find no general trace of Cicero in the play
entitles us to suggest a connection in this special
case with Montaigne, of whom we do find so
many other traces. It is easy besides to push
the theory of any influence too far; and when
for instance we find Hamlet saying he fares "Of
the chameleon's dish: I eat the air, promise-crammed,"
it would be as idle to assume a reminiscence
of a passage of Montaigne on the chameleon<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
as it would be to derive Hamlet's phrase
"A king of shreds and patches" from Florio's
rendering in the essay<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> <span class="smcap">Of the Inconstancy of
our Actions</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We are all framed of flaps and patches, and of so
shapeless and diverse a contexture, that every piece and
every moment playeth his part."</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>
<p>In the latter case we have a mere coincidence
of idiom; in the former a proverbial allusion.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
An uncritical pursuit of such mere accidents of
resemblance has led Mr. Feis to such enormities
as the assertion that Shakspere's contemporaries
knew Hamlet's use of his tablets to be a
parody of the "much-scribbling Montaigne,"
who had avowed that he made much use of his;
the assertion that Ophelia's "Come, my coach!"
has reference to Montaigne's remark that he has
known ladies who would rather lend their
honour than their coach; and a dozen other
propositions, if possible still more amazing.
But when, with no foregone conclusion as to
any polemic purpose on Shakspere's part, we
restrict ourselves to real parallels of thought
and expression; when we find that a certain
number of these are actually textual; when we
find further that in a single soliloquy in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>play there are several reproductions of ideas in
the essays, some of them frequently recurring in
Montaigne; and when finally it is found that,
with only one exception, all the passages in
question have been added to the play in the
Second Quarto, after the publication of Florio's
translation, it seems hardly possible to doubt
that the translation influenced the dramatist in
his work.</p>

<p>Needless to say, the influence is from the very
start of that high sort in which he that takes
becomes co-thinker with him that gives, Shakspere's
absorption of Montaigne being as vital
as Montaigne's own assimilation of the thought
of his classics. The process is one not of surface
reflection, but of kindling by contact; and
we seem to see even the vibration of the style
passing from one intelligence to the other; the
nervous and copious speech of Montaigne
awakening Shakspere to a new sense of power
over rhythm and poignant phrase, at the same
time that the stimulus of the thought gives him
a new confidence in the validity of his own reflection.
Some cause there must have been for this
marked species of development in the dramatist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
at that particular time; and if we find pervading
signs of one remarkable new influence, with no
countervailing evidence of another adequate to
the effect, the inference is about as reasonable as
many which pass for valid in astronomy. For it
will be found, on the one hand, that there is no
sign worth considering of a Montaigne influence
on Shakspere before <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>; and, on the other
hand, that the influence to some extent continues
beyond that play. Indeed, there are still
further minute signs of it there, which should be
noted before we pass on.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XIII. Among parallelisms of thought of a
less direct kind, one may be traced between an
utterance of Hamlet's and a number of Montaigne's
sayings on the power of imagination
and the possible equivalence of dream life and
waking life. In his first dialogue with Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern, where we have already
noted an echo of Montaigne, Hamlet cries:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell, and
count myself a king of infinite space; were it not that
I have bad dreams;"</p></div>

<p>and Guildenstern answers:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Which dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a
dream."</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>The first sentence may be compared with a
number in Montaigne,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> of which the following<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
is a type:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Man clean contrary [to the Gods] possesseth goods
in imagination and evils essentially. We have had
reason to make the powers of our imagination to be of
force, for all our felicities are but in conceipt, and as
it were in a dream;"</p></div>

<p>while the reply of Guildenstern further recalls
several of the passages already cited.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XIV. Another apparent parallel of no great
importance, but of more verbal closeness, is that
between Hamlet's jeering phrase:<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> "Your worm
is your only emperor for diet," and a sentence
in the <span class="smcap">Apology</span>: "The heart and the life of a
great and triumphant emperor are the dinner of
a little worm," which M. Stapfer compares
further with the talk of Hamlet in the grave-diggers'
scene. Here, doubtless, we are near the
level of proverbial sayings, current in all
countries.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XV. As regards <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, I can find no
further parallelisms so direct as any of the foregoing,
except some to be considered later, in con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>nection
with the "To be" soliloquy. I do not
think it can be made out that, as M. Chasles
affirmed, Hamlet's words on his friendship for
Horatio can be traced directly to any of Montaigne's
passages on that theme. "It would be
easy," says M. Chasles, "to show in Shakspere
the <i>branloire perenne</i><a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> of Montaigne, and the
whole magnificent passage on friendship, which
is found reproduced (<i>se trouve report&eacute;</i>) in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>."
The idea of the world as a perpetual mutation
is certainly prevalent in Shakspere's
work; but I can find no exact correspondence of
phrase between Montaigne's pages on his love
for his dead friend Etienne de la Bo&euml;tie and the
lines in which Hamlet speaks of his love for
Horatio. He rather gives his reasons for his
love than describes the nature and completeness
of it in Montaigne's way; and as regards the
description of Horatio, it could have been independently
suggested by such a treatise as
Seneca's <span class="smcap">De Constantia Sapientis</span>, which is a
monody on the theme with which it closes: <i>esse
aliquem invictum, esse aliquem in quem nihil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>fortuna possit</i>&mdash;"to be something unconquered,
something against which fortune is powerless."
In the fifth section the idea is worded in a
fashion that could have suggested Shakspere's
utterance of it; and he might easily have met
with some citation of the kind. But, on the
other hand, this note of passionate friendship is
not only new in Shakspere but new in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>,
in respect of the First Quarto, in which the main
part of the speech to Horatio does not occur, and
in view of the singular fact that in the first Act
of the play as it stands Hamlet greets Horatio
as a mere acquaintance; and it is further to be
noted that the description of Horatio as "one
in suffering all that suffers nothing" is broadly
suggested by the quotation from Horace in Montaigne's
nineteenth chapter (which, as we have
already seen, impressed Shakspere), and by
various other sayings in the Essays. After the
quotation from Horace (<i>Non vultus instantis
tyranni</i>), in the Nineteenth Essay, Florio's
translation runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"She (the soul) is made mistress of her passions and
concupiscences, lady of indigence, of shame, of poverty,
and of all fortune's injuries. Let him that can, attain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>to this advantage. Herein consists the true and sovereign
liberty, that affords us means wherewith to jest
and make a scorn of force and injustice, and to deride
imprisonment, gyves, or fetters."</p></div>

<p>Again, in the essay <span class="smcap">Of Three Commerces or
Societies</span>,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> we have this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We must not cleave so fast unto our humours and
dispositions. Our chiefest sufficiency is to supply ourselves
to diverse fashions. It is a being, but not a life,
to be tied and bound by necessity to one only course.
The goodliest minds are those that have most variety
and pliableness in them.... Life is a motion unequal,
irregular, and multiform....</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"... My fortune having inured and allured
me, even from my infancy, to one sole, singular, and
perfect amity, hath verily in some sort distasted me
from others.... So that it is naturally a pain
unto me to communicate myself by halves, and with
modification....</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I should commend a high-raised mind that could
both bend and discharge itself; that wherever her fortune
might transport her, she might continue constant....
I envy those which can be familiar with the
meanest of their followers, and vouchsafe to contract
friendship and frame discourse with their own servants."</p></div>

<p>Again, la Bo&euml;tie is panegyrised by Montaigne
for his rare poise and firmness of character;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>and elsewhere in the essays we find many allusions
to the ideal of the imperturbable man,
which Montaigne has in the above cited passages
brought into connection with his ideal of friendship.
It could well be, then&mdash;though here we
cannot argue the point with confidence&mdash;that in
this as in other matters the strong general
impression that Montaigne was so well fitted to
make on Shakspere's mind was the source of
such a change in the conception and exposition
of Hamlet's relation to Horatio as is set up by
Hamlet's protestation of his long-standing
admiration and love for his friend. Shakspere's
own relations with one or other of his noble
patrons would make him specially alive to such
suggestion.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XVI. We now come to the suggested resemblance
between the "To be or not to be" soliloquy
and the general tone of Montaigne on the subject
of death. On this resemblance I am less
disposed to lay stress now than I was on a first
consideration of the subject thirteen years ago.
While I find new coincidences of detail on a
more systematic search, I am less impressed by
the alleged general resemblance of tone. In
point of fact, the general drift of Hamlet's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
soliloquy is rather alien to the general tone of
Montaigne on the same theme. That tone, as
we shall see, harmonises much more nearly with
the speech of the Duke to Claudio, on the same
theme, in <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>. What really
seems to subsist in the "To be" soliloquy, after
a careful scrutiny, is a series of echoes of single
thoughts; but there is the difficulty that some
of these occur in the earlier form of the soliloquy
in the First Quarto, a circumstance which tends&mdash;though
not necessarily<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>&mdash;to throw a shade of
doubt on the apparent echoes in the finished
form of the speech. We can but weigh the facts
as impartially as may be.</p>

<p>First, there is the striking coincidence of the
word "consummation" (which appears only in
the Second Quarto), with Florio's translation of
<i>an&eacute;antissement</i> in the essay <span class="smcap">Of Physiognomy</span>, as
above noted. Secondly, there is a curious resemblance
between the phrase "take arms against
a sea of troubles" and a passage in Florio's version
of the same essay, which has somehow been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>overlooked in the disputes over Shakspere's
line. It runs:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I sometimes suffer myself by starts to be surprised
with the pinchings of these unpleasant conceits, which,
whilst I arm myself to expel or wrestle against them,
assail and beat me. Lo here another huddle or tide of
mischief, that on the neck of the former came rushing
upon me."</p></div>

<p>There arises here the difficulty that Shakspere's
line had been satisfactorily traced to
&AElig;lian's<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> story of the Celtic practice of rushing
into the sea to resist a high tide with weapons;
and the matter must, I think, be left open until
it can he ascertained whether the statement concerning
the Celts was available to Shakspere in
any translation or citation.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>Again, the phrase "Conscience doth make
cowards of us all" is very like the echo of two
passages in the essay<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> <span class="smcap">Of Conscience</span>: "Of such
marvellous working power is the sting of conscience:
which often induceth us to bewray, to
accuse, and to combat ourselves"; "which as
it doth fill us with fear and doubt, so doth it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>store us with assurance and trust;" and the
lines about "the dread of something after
death" might point to the passage in the Fortieth
Essay, in which Montaigne cites the saying of
Augustine that "Nothing but what follows
death, makes death to be evil" (<i>malam mortem
non facit, nisi quod sequitur mortem</i>) cited by
Montaigne in order to dispute it. The same
thought, too, is dealt with in the essay<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> on <span class="smcap">A
Custom of the Isle of Cea</span>, which contains a passage
suggestive of Hamlet's earlier soliloquy on
self-slaughter. But, for one thing, Hamlet's
soliloquies are contrary in drift to Montaigne's
argument; and, for another, the phrase "Conscience
makes cowards of us all" existed in the
soliloquy as it stood in the First Quarto, while
the gist of the idea is actually found twice in a
previous play, where it has a proverbial ring.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
And "the <i>hope</i> of something after death"
figures in the First Quarto also.</p>

<p>Finally, there are other sources than Montaigne
for parts of the soliloquy, sources nearer,
too, than those which have been pointed to in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>the Senecan tragedies. There is, indeed, as Dr.
Cunliffe has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> a broad correspondence
between the whole soliloquy and the chorus of
women at the end of the second Act of the
<span class="smcap">Troades</span>, where the question of a life beyond is
pointedly put:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Verum est? an timidos fabula decepit,</span>
<span class="i0">Umbras corporibus vivere conditis?"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is true that the choristers in Seneca pronounce
definitely against the future life:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Post mortem nihil est, ipsaque mors nihil....</span>
<span class="i0">Rumores vacui verbaque inania,</span>
<span class="i0">Et par sollicito fabula somnio."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But wherever in Christendom the pagan's words
were discussed, the Christian hypothesis would
be pitted against his unbelief, with the effect of
making one thought overlay the other; and in
this fused form the discussion may easily have
reached Shakspere's eye and ear. So it would
be with the echo of two Senecan passages noted
by Mr. Munro in the verses on "the undiscovered
country from whose bourn no traveller
returns." In the <span class="smcap">Hercules Furens</span><a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> we have:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Nemo ad id sero venit, unde nunquam</span>
<span class="i0">Quum semel venit potuit reverti;"</span>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>
<p>and in the <span class="smcap">Hercules &OElig;t&aelig;us</span><a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> there is the same
thought:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6_5">"regnum canis inquieti</span>
<span class="i0">Unde non unquam remeavit ullus."</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>But here, as elsewhere, Seneca himself was
employing a standing sentiment, for in the best
known poem of Catullus we have:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Qui nunc it per iter tenebricosum</span>
<span class="i0">Illuc, unde negant redire quemquam."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>And though there was in Shakspere's day no
English translation of Catullus, the commentators
long ago noted<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> that in Sandford's translation
of Cornelius Agrippa (? 1569), there
occurs the phrase, "The countrie of the dead is
irremeable, that they cannot return," a fuller
parallel to the passage in the soliloquy than anything
cited from the classics.</p>

<p>Finally, in Marlowe's <span class="smcap">Edward II.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> written
before 1593, we have:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6_5">"Weep not for Mortimer,</span>
<span class="i0">That scorns the world, and, as a traveller,</span>
<span class="i0">Goes to discover countries yet unknown."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>
<p>So that, without going to the Latin, we have
obvious English sources for notable parts of the
soliloquy.</p>

<p>Thus, though Shakspere may (1) have seen
part of the Florio translation, or separate translations
of some of the essays, before the issue of
the First Quarto; or may (2) easily have heard
that very point discussed by Florio, who was
the friend of his friend Jonson, or by those who
had read the original; or may even (3) himself
have read in the original; and though further
it seems quite certain that his "consummation
devoutly to be wished" was an echo of Florio's
translation of the Apology of Socrates; on the
other hand we are not entitled to trace the
soliloquy as a whole to Montaigne's stimulation
of Shakspere's thought. That Shakspere read
Montaigne in the original once seemed probable
to me, as to others; but, on closer study, I consider
it unlikely, were it only because the Montaigne
influence in his work begins, as aforesaid,
in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>. Of all the apparent coincidences I
have noticed between Shakspere's previous plays
and the essays, none has any evidential value.
(1) The passage on the music of the spheres in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
the <span class="smcap">Merchant of Venice</span><a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> recalls the passage on
the subject in Montaigne's essay of <span class="smcap">Custom</span>;<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
but then the original source is Cicero, <span class="smcap">In Somnium
Scipionis</span>, which had been translated into
English in 1577. (2) Falstaff's rhapsody on the
virtues of sherris<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> recalls a passage in the essay
<span class="smcap">of Drunkenness</span>,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> but then Montaigne avows
that what he says is the common doctrine of wine-drinkers.
(3) Montaigne cites<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> the old saying
of Petronius, that "all the world's a stage,"
which occurs in <span class="smcap">As You Like It</span>; but the phrase
itself, being preserved by John of Salisbury,
would be current in England. It is, indeed, said
to have been the motto of the Globe Theatre.
Thus, while we are the more strongly convinced
of a Montaigne influence beginning with <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>,
we are bound to concede the doubtfulness
of any apparent influence before the Second
Quarto. At most we may say that both of Hamlet's
soliloquies which touch on suicide evidently
owe something to the discussions set up by Montaigne's
essays.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>
<p>XVII. In the case of the Duke's exhortation
to Claudio in <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, on the
contrary, the whole speech may be said to be a
synthesis of favourite propositions of Montaigne.
The thought in itself, of course, is not
new or out-of-the-way; it is nearly all to be
found suggested in the Latin classics; but in
the light of what is certain for us as to
Shakspere's study of Montaigne, and of the
whole cast of the expression, it is difficult to
doubt that Montaigne is for Shakspere the
source. Let us take a number of passages from
Florio's translation of the Nineteenth Essay, to
begin with:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The end of our career is death: it is the necessary
object of our aim; if it affright us, how is it possible
we should step one foot further without an ague?"</p>

<p>"What hath an aged man left him of his youth's
vigour, and of his fore past life?... When youth
fails in us, we feel, nay we perceive, no shaking or
transchange at all in ourselves: which is essence and
verity is a harder death than that of a languishing
and irksome life, or that of age. Forasmuch as the
leap from an ill being into a not being is not so dangerous
or steepy as it is from a delightful and flourishing
being into a painful and sorrowful condition. A weak
bending and faint stopping body hath less strength to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>bear and undergo a heavy burden: So hath our soul."</p>

<p>"Our religion hath no surer human foundation than
the contempt of life. Discourse of reason doth not only
call and summon us unto it. For why should we fear to
lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be moaned? But
also, since we are threatened by so many kinds of death,
there is no more inconvenience to fear them all than to
endure one: what matter it when it cometh, since it
is unavoidable?... Death is a part of yourselves;
you fly from yourselves. The being you enjoy is equally
shared between life and death ... The continual
work of your life is to contrive death; you are in
death during the time you continue in life ...
during life you are still dying."</p></div>

<p>The same line of expostulation occurs in other
essays. In the Fortieth we have:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Now death, which some of all horrible things call
the most horrible, who knows not how others call it the
only haven of this life's torments? the sovereign good
of nature? the only stay of our liberty? and the ready
and common receipt of our evils?...</p>

<p>"... Death is but felt by discourse, because it
is the emotion of an instant. A thousand beasts, a
thousand men, are sooner dead than threatened."</p></div>

<p>Then take a passage occurring near the end of
the <span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond Sebonde</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We do foolishly fear a kind of death, whereas we
have already passed and daily pass so many others....
The flower of age dieth, fadeth, and fleeteth,
when age comes upon us, and youth endeth in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>flower of a full-grown man's age, childhood in youth,
and the first age dieth in infancy; and yesterday
endeth in this day, and to-day shall die in to-morrow."</p></div>

<p>Now compare textually the Duke's speech:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Be absolute for death: either death or life</span>
<span class="i0">Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing</span>
<span class="i0">That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,</span>
<span class="i0">(Servile to all the skiey influences)</span>
<span class="i0">That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,</span>
<span class="i0">Hourly afflict: merely, thou are death's fool;</span>
<span class="i0">For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun,</span>
<span class="i0">And yet run'st towards him still: Thou art not noble;</span>
<span class="i0">For all the accommodations that thou bear'st</span>
<span class="i0">Are nursed by baseness: Thou art by no means valiant,</span>
<span class="i0">For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork</span>
<span class="i0">Of a poor worm: Thy best of rest is sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">And that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st</span>
<span class="i0">Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;</span>
<span class="i0">For thou exist'st on many thousand grains</span>
<span class="i0">Which issue out of dust: Happy thou art not;</span>
<span class="i0">For what thou hast not, still thou striv'st to get,</span>
<span class="i0">And what thou hast forget'st: Thou art not certain,</span>
<span class="i0">For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,</span>
<span class="i0">After the moon: If thou art rich, thou art poor;</span>
<span class="i0">For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey,</span>
<span class="i0">And death unloads thee: Friend hast thou none;</span>
<span class="i0">For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
<span class="i0">Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,</span>
<span class="i0">For ending thee no sooner: Thou hast no youth nor age,</span>
<span class="i0">But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,</span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming on both: for all thy blessed youth</span>

<span class="i0">Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,</span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast neither heat, affection, limbs, nor beauty,</span>
<span class="i0">To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this,</span>
<span class="i0">That bears the name of life? Yet in this life</span>
<span class="i0">Lie hid more thousand deaths: yet death we fear,</span>
<span class="i0">That makes these odds all even."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then collate yet further some more passages
from the Essays:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They perceived her (the soul) to be capable of
diverse passions, and agitated by many languishing
and painful motions ... subject to her infirmities,
diseases, and offences, even as the stomach or the foot
... dazzled and troubled by the force of wine;
removed from her seat by the vapours of a burning
fever.... She was seen to dismay and confound all
her faculties by the only biting of a sick dog, and to
contain no great constancy of discourse, no virtue, no
philosophical resolution, no contention of her forces,
that might exempt her from the subjection of these
accidents...."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is not without reason we are taught to take notice
of our sleep, for the resemblance it hath with death.
How easily we pass from waking to sleeping; with how
little interest we lose the knowledge of light, and of
ourselves...."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>"Wherefore as we from that instant take a title of
being, which is but a twinkling in the infinite course of
an eternal night, and so short an interruption of our
perpetual and natural condition, death possessing whatever
is before and behind this moment, and also a good
part of this moment, "<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>"Every human nature is ever in the middle between
being born and dying, giving nothing of itself but an
obscure appearance and shadow, and an uncertain and
weak opinion."<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p></div>

<p>Compare finally the line "Thy best of rest is
sleep" (where the word rest seems a printer's
error) with the passage "We find nothing so
sweet in life as a quiet and gentle sleep," already
cited in connection with our fourth parallel.</p>
<p class="two">&nbsp;</p>
<p>XVIII. The theme, in fine, is one of Montaigne's
favourites. And the view that Shakspere
had been impressed by it seems to be
decisively corroborated by the fact that the
speech of Claudio to Isabella, expressing those
fears of death which the Duke seeks to calm, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>likewise an echo of a whole series of passages in
Montaigne. Shakspere's lines run:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Ay, but to die, and go we know not where,</span>
<span class="i0">To lie in cold obstruction and to rot:</span>
<span class="i0">This sensible warm motion to become</span>
<span class="i0">A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit</span>
<span class="i0">To bathe in fiery floods or to reside</span>
<span class="i0">In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice,</span>
<span class="i0">To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,</span>
<span class="i0">And blown with restless violence round about</span>
<span class="i0">The pendent world; or to be worse than worst</span>
<span class="i0">Of those, that lawless and incertain thoughts</span>
<span class="i0">Imagine howling!&mdash;'tis too horrible!..."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>So far as I know, the only idea in this passage
which belongs to the current English superstition
of Shakspere's day, apart from the natural
notion of death as a mere rotting of the body,
is that of the purgatorial fire; unless we assume
that the common superstition as to the souls of
unbaptised children being blown about until the
day of judgment was extended in the popular
imagination to the case of executed criminals.
He may have heard of the account given by
Empedocles, as cited in Plutarch,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> of the punishment
of the offending d&aelig;mons, who were whirled
between earth and air and sun and sea; but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>there is no suggestion in that passage that human
souls were so treated. Dante's <span class="smcap">Inferno</span>, with its
pictures of carnal sinners tossed about by the
winds in the dark air of the second circle,<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and
of traitors punished by freezing in the ninth,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>
was probably not known to the dramatist; nor
does Dante's vision coincide with Claudio's, in
which the souls are blown "about the pendent
world." Shakspere may indeed have heard
some of the old tales of a hot and cold purgatory,
such as that of Drithelm, given by Bede,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
whence (rather than from Dante) Milton drew
his idea of an alternate torture.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> But there
again, the correspondence is only partial;
whereas in Montaigne's <span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond
Sebonde</span> we find, poetry apart, nearly every
notion that enters into Claudio's speech:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The most universal and received fantasy, and which
endureth to this day, hath been that whereof Pythagoras
is made author ... which is that souls at
their departure from us did but pass and roll from one
to another body, from a lion to a horse, from a horse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>to a king, incessantly wandering up and down, from
house to mansion.... Some added more, that the
same souls do sometimes ascend up to heaven, and
come down again.... Origen waked them eternally,
to go and come from a good to a bad estate. The
opinion that Varro reporteth is, that in the revolutions
of four hundred and forty years they reconjoin themselves
unto their first bodies.... Behold her (the
soul's) progress elsewhere: He that hath lived well reconjoineth
himself unto that star or planet to which he
is assigned; who evil, passeth into a woman. And if
then he amend not himself, he transchangeth himself
into a beast, of condition agreeing to his vicious customs,
and shall never see an end of his punishments
until ... by virtue of reason he have deprived himself
of those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities that
were in him.... They (the Epicureans) demand,
what order there should be if the throng of the dying
should be greater than that of such as be born ...
and demand besides, what they should pass their time
about, whilst they should stay, until any other mansion
were made ready for them.... Others have staved
the soul in the deceased bodies, wherewith to animate
serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to
engender from the corruption of our members, yea, and
from our ashes.... Others make it immortal without
any science or knowledge. Nay, there are some of ours
who have deemed that of condemned men's souls devils
were made...."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p></div>

<p>It is at a short distance from this passage that
we find the suggestion of a frozen purgatory:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Amongst them (barbarous nations) was also found
the belief of purgatory, but after a new form, for what
we ascribe unto fire they impute unto cold, and imagine
that souls are both purged and punished by the vigor
of an extreme coldness."<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p></div>

<p>And over and above this peculiar correspondence
between the Essays and the two
speeches on death, we may note how some of the
lines of the Duke in the opening scene connect
with two of the passages above cited in connection
with Hamlet's last soliloquy, expressing the idea
that nature or deity confers gifts in order that
they should be used. The Duke's lines are
among Shakspere's best:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"Thyself and thy belongings</span>
<span class="i0">Are not thine own so proper as to waste</span>
<span class="i0">Thyself upon thy virtues, them on thee.</span>
<span class="i0">Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,</span>
<span class="i0">Not light them for themselves: for if our virtues</span>
<span class="i0">Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike</span>
<span class="i0">As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touched</span>
<span class="i0">But to fine issues: nor nature never lends</span>
<span class="i0">The smallest scruple of her excellence,</span>
<span class="i0">But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines</span>
<span class="i0">Herself the glory of a creditor,</span>
<span class="i0">Both thanks and use...."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here we have once more a characteristically
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>Shaksperean transmutation and development of
the idea rather than a reproduction; and the
same appears when we compare the admirable
lines of the poet with a homiletic sentence from
the <span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond Sebonde</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is not enough for us to serve God in spirit and
soul; we owe him besides and we yield unto him a
corporal worshipping: we apply our limbs, our motions,
and all external things to honour him."</p></div>

<p>But granting the philosophic as well as the
poetic heightening, we are still led to infer a
stimulation of the poet's thought by the Essays&mdash;a
stimulation not limited to one play, but
affecting other plays written about the same
time. Another point of connection between
<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> and <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span> is seen
when we compare the above passage, "Spirits
are not finely touched but to fine issues," with
Laertes' lines<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Nature is fine in love, and when 'tis fine</span>
<span class="i0">It sends some precious instance of itself</span>
<span class="i0">After the thing it loves."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>And though such data are of course not conclusive
as to the time of composition of the
plays, there is so much of identity between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>thought in the Duke's speech, just quoted, and
a notable passage in <span class="smcap">Troilus and Cressida</span>, as
to strengthen greatly the surmise that the latter
play was also written, or rather worked-over, by
Shakspere about 1604. The phrase:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"if our virtues</span>
<span class="i0">Did not go forth of us, 'twere all the same</span>
<span class="i0">As if we had them not,"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>is developed in the speech of Ulysses to
Achilles<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"A strange fellow here</span>
<span class="i0">Writes me that man&mdash;how dearly ever parted</span>
<span class="i0">How much in having, or without, or in&mdash;</span>
<span class="i0">Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</span>
<span class="i0">Nor feels not what he knows, but by reflection;</span>
<span class="i0">As when his virtues shining upon others</span>
<span class="i0">Heat them, and they retort their heat again</span>
<span class="i0">To the first giver."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>I do not remember in Montaigne any such
development of the idea as Shakspere here gives
it; indeed, we have seen him putting forth a
contrary teaching; and looking to the context,
where Ulysses admits the thesis to be "familiar,"
we are bound to infer a direct source for it. In
all probability it derives from Seneca, who in
his treatise <span class="smcap">De Beneficiis</span><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> throws out the germ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>of the ideas as to Nature demanding back her
gifts, and as to virtue being nothing if not
reflected; and even suggests the principle of
"thanks and use."<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> This treatise, too, lay to
Shakspere's hand in the translation of 1578,
where the passages: "Rerum natura nihil
dicitur perdere, quia quidquid illi avellitur, ad
illam redit; nec perire quidquam potest, quod
quo excidat non habet, sed eodem evolvitur unde
discedit"; and "quaedam quum sint honesta,
pulcherrima summae virtutis, nisi cum altero
non habent locum," are translated:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The nature of a thing cannot be said to have foregone
aught, because that whatsoever is plucked from it
returneth to it again; neither can anything be lost
which hath not whereout of to pass, but windeth back
again unto whence it came;"</p></div>

<p>and</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Some things though they be honest, very goodly
and right excellently vertuous, yet have they not their
effect but in a co-partner."</p></div>

<p>Whether it was Shakspere's reading of Montaigne
that sent him to Seneca, to whom Montaigne<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
avows so much indebtedness, we of
course cannot tell; but it is enough for the
purpose of our argument to say that we have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>here another point or stage in a line of analytical
thought on which Shakspere was
embarked about 1603, and of which the starting
point or initial stimulus was the perusal of
Florio's Montaigne. We have the point of contact
with Montaigne in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, where the
saying that reason is implanted in us to be
used, is seen to be one of the many correspondences
of thought between the play and the
Essays. The idea is more subtly and deeply
developed in <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, and still
more subtly and philosophically in <span class="smcap">Troilus and
Cressida</span>. The fact of the process of development
is all that is here affirmed, over and above
the actual phenomena of reproduction before set
forth.</p>

<p>As to these, the proposition is that in sum
they constitute such an amount of reproduction
of Montaigne as explains Jonson's phrase about
habitual "stealings." There is no justification
for applying that to the passage in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>,
since not only is that play not known to have
existed in its present form in 1605,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> when <span class="smcap">Vol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>pone</span>
was produced, but the phrase plainly
alleges not one but many borrowings. I am
not aware that extracts from Montaigne have
been traced in any others of the English contemporary
dramatists. But here in two plays
of Shakspere, then fresh in memory&mdash;the
Second Quarto having been published in 1604
and <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span> produced in the
same year&mdash;were echoes enough from Montaigne
to be noted by Jonson, whom we know to have
owned, as did Shakspere, the Florio folio, and
to have been Florio's warm admirer. And there
seems to be a confirmation of our thesis in the
fact that, while we find detached passages
savouring of Montaigne in some later plays of
the same period, as in one of the concluding
period, the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>, we do not again find in any
one play such a cluster of reminiscences as we
have seen in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> and <span class="smcap">Measure for
Measure</span>, though the spirit of Montaigne's
thought, turned to a deepening pessimism, may
be said to tinge all the later tragedies.</p>

<p>(a) In <span class="smcap">Othello</span> (? 1604) we have Iago's "'tis
in ourselves that we are thus or thus," already
considered, to say nothing of Othello's phrase<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"I saw it not, thought it not, it harmed not me....</span>
<span class="i0">He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolen,</span>
<span class="i0">Let him not know it, and he's not robb'd at all."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>&mdash;a philosophical commonplace which compares
with various passages in the Fortieth Essay.</p>

<p>(b) In <span class="smcap">Lear</span> (1606) we have such a touch as
the king's lines<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"And take upon's the mystery of things</span>
<span class="i0">As if we were God's spies;"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>&mdash;which recalls the vigorous protest of the
essays, <span class="smcap">that a man ought soberly to meddle
with the judging of the divine laws</span>,<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> where Montaigne
avows that if he dared he would put in
the category of imposters the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"interpreters and ordinary controllers of the designs of
God, setting about to find the causes of each accident,
and to see in the secrets of the divine will the incomprehensible
motives of its works."</p></div>

<p>This, again, is a recurrent note with Montaigne;
and much of the argument of the
<span class="smcap">Apology</span> is typified in the sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What greater vanity can there be than to go about
by our proportions and conjectures to guess at God?"</p></div>

<p>(c) But there is a yet more striking coincidence
between a passage in the essay<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> of <span class="smcap">Judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>ing
of Others' Death</span> and the speech of
Edmund<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> on the subject of stellar influences. In
the essay Montaigne sharply derides the habit of
ascribing human occurrences to the interference
of the stars&mdash;which very superstition he was
later to support by his own authority in the
<span class="smcap">Apology</span>, as we have seen above, in the passage
on the "power and domination" of the celestial
bodies. The passage in the thirteenth essay is
the more notable in itself, being likewise a protest
against human self-sufficiency, though the
bearing of the illustration is directly reversed.
Here he derides man's conceit: "We entertain
and carry all with us: whence it followeth that
we deem our death to be some great matter, and
which passeth not so easily, nor without a
solemn consultation of the stars." Then follow
references to C&aelig;sar's sayings as to his star, and
the "common foppery" as to the sun mourning
his death a year.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"And a thousand such, wherewith the world suffers
itself to be so easily cony-catched, deeming that our
own interests disturb heaven, and his infinity is moved
at our least actions. 'There is no such society between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>heaven and us that by our destiny the shining of the
stars should be as mortal as we are.'"</p></div>

<p>There seems to be an unmistakable reminiscence
of this passage in Edmund's speech, where the
word "foppery" is a special clue:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"This is the excellent foppery of the world! that when
we are sick in fortune (often the surfeit of our own
behaviour), we make guilty of our disasters the sun,
the moon, and the stars: as if we were villains by
necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves,
thieves, and traitors by spherical predominance; drunkards,
liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by
divine thrusting on...."</p></div>

<p>(d) Again, in <span class="smcap">Macbeth</span> (1606), the words of
Malcolm to Macduff<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak,</span>
<span class="i0">Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>&mdash;an idea which also underlies Macbeth's "this
perilous stuff, which weighs upon the heart"&mdash;recalls
the essay<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> <span class="smcap">Of Sadness</span>, in which Montaigne
remarks on the</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"mournful silent stupidity which so doth pierce us
when accidents surpassing our strength overwhelm us,"
and on the way in which "the soul, bursting afterwards
forth into tears and complaints ... seemeth to clear
and dilate itself"; going on to tell how the German
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>Lord Raisciac looked on his dead son "till the vehemency
of his sad sorrow, having suppressed and choked
his vital spirits, felled him stark dead to the ground."</p></div>

<p>The parallel here, such as it is, is at least
much more vivid than that drawn between
Shakspere's lines and one of Seneca:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Curae leves loquuntur: ingentes stupent<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>&mdash;"Light
troubles speak: the great ones are dumb."</p></div>

<p>Certainly no one of these latter passages would
singly suffice to prove that Shakspere had read
Montaigne, though the peculiar coincidence of
one word in Edgar's speech with a word in
Florio, above noted, would alone raise the question.
But even had Shakspere not passed, as we
shall see cause to acknowledge, beyond the most
melancholy mood of Montaigne into one of far
sterner and more stringent pessimism, an
absence or infrequency of suggestions of Montaigne
in the plays between 1605 and 1610 would
be a very natural result of Jonson's gibe in
<span class="smcap">Volpone</span>. That gibe, indeed, is not really so
ill-natured as the term "steal" is apt to make
it sound for our ears, especially if we are prepossessed&mdash;as
even Mr. Fleay still seems to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>&mdash;by
the old commentators' notion of a deep ill-will
on Jonson's part towards Shakspere.
There was probably no such ill-will in the
matter, the burly scholar's habit of robust
banter being enough to account for the form of
his remark. As a matter of fact, his own plays
are strewn with classic transcriptions; and
though he evidently plumed himself on his
power of "invention"<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> in the matter of plots&mdash;a
faculty which he knew Shakspere to lack&mdash;he
cannot conceivably have meant to charge his
rival with having committed any discreditable
plagiarism in drawing upon Montaigne. At
most he would mean to convey that borrowing
from the English translation of Montaigne was
an easy game as compared with his own scholar-like
practice of translating from the Greek and
Latin, and from out-of-the-way authors, too.</p>

<p>However that might be, the fact stands that
Shakspere did about 1604 reproduce Montaigne
as we have seen; and it remains to consider
what the reproduction signifies, as regards
Shakspere's mental development.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>
<h3>III.</h3>


<p>But first there has to be asked the question
whether the Montaigne influence is unique or
exceptional. Of the many literary influences
which an Elizabethan dramatist might undergo,
was Montaigne's the only one which wrought
deeply upon Shakspere's spirit, apart from
those of his contemporary dramatists and the
pre-existing plays, which were then models and
points of departure? It is clear that Shakspere
must have thought much and critically of the
methods and the utterance of his co-rivals in
literary art, as he did of the methods of his
fellow-actors. The author of the advice to the
players in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> was hardly less a critic than
a poet; and the sonnet<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> which speaks of its
author as</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,"<br />
</p></div>

<p>is one of the least uncertain revelations that
these enigmatic poems yield us. We may confidently
decide, too, with Professor Minto,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> that
the Eighty-sixth Sonnet, beginning:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Was it the full, proud sail of his great verse?"<br />
</p></div>

<p>has reference to Chapman, in whom Shakspere
might well see one of his most formidable competitors
in poetry. But we are here concerned
with influences of thought, as distinct from
influences of artistic example; and the question
is: Do the plays show any other culture-contact
comparable to that which we have been led to
recognise in the case of Montaigne's Essays?</p>

<p>The matter cannot be said to have been very
fully investigated when even the Montaigne
influence has been thus far left so much in the
vague. As regards the plots, there has been
exhaustive and instructive research during two
centuries; and of collations of parallel passages,
apart from Montaigne, there has been no lack;
but the deeper problem of the dramatist's mental
history can hardly be said to have arisen till our
own generation. As regards many of the
parallel passages, the ground has been pretty
well cleared by the dispassionate scholarship
brought to bear on them from Farmer onwards;
though the idolatry of the Coleridgean school,
as represented by Knight, did much to retard
scientific conclusions on this as on other points.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>Farmer's Essay on the Learning of Shakspere
(1767) proved for all open-minded readers that
much of Shakspere's supposed classical knowledge
was derived from translations alone;<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> and
further investigation does but establish his
general view.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> Such is the effect of M. Stapfer's
chapter on Shakspere's Classical Knowledge;<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>
and the pervading argument of that chapter will
be found to hold good as against the view suggested,
with judicious diffidence, by Dr. John
W. Cunliffe, concerning the influence of Seneca's
tragedies on Shakspere's. Unquestionably the
body of Senecan tragedy, as Dr. Cunliffe's valuable
research has shown, did much to colour the
style and thought of the Elizabethan drama, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>well as to suggest its themes and shape its technique.
But it is noteworthy that while there
are in the plays, as we have seen, apparent echoes
from the Senecan treatises, and while, as we
have seen, Dr. Cunliffe suggests sources for some
Shaksperean passages in the Senecan tragedies,
he is doubtful as to whether they represent any
direct study of Seneca by Shakspere.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Whether Shakspere was directly indebted to
Seneca," he writes, "is a question as difficult as it is
interesting. As English tragedy advances, there
grows up an accumulation of Senecan influence
within the English drama, in addition to the
original source, and it becomes increasingly difficult
to distinguish between the direct and the
indirect influence of Seneca. In no case is the
difficulty greater than in that of Shakspere. Of
Marlowe, Jonson, Chapman, Marston, and Massinger,
we can say with certainty that they read Seneca, and
reproduced their readings in their tragedies; of Middleton
and Heywood we can say with almost equal
certainty that they give no sign of direct indebtedness
to Seneca; and that they probably came only under
the indirect influence, through the imitations of their
predecessors and contemporaries. In the case of Shakspere
we cannot be absolutely certain either way. Professor
Baynes thinks it is probable that Shakspere
read Seneca at school; and even if he did not, we may
be sure that, at some period of his career, he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>turn to the generally accepted model of classical
tragedy, either in the original or in the translation."<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p></div>

<p>This seems partially inconsistent; and, so far
as the evidence from particular parallels goes,
we are not led to take with any confidence the
view put in the last sentence. The above-noted
parallels between Seneca's tragedies and Shakspere's
are but cases of citation of sentences
likely to have grown proverbial; and the most
notable of the others that have been cited by
Dr. Cunliffe is one which, as he notes, points to
&AElig;schylus as well as to Seneca. The cry of
Macbeth:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood</span>
<span class="i0">Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather</span>
<span class="i0">The multitudinous seas incarnadine,</span>
<span class="i0">Making the green one red:"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>certainly corresponds closely with that of
Seneca's Hercules:<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

</div>
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>
<p>and that of Seneca's Hippolytus:<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<span class="i0">Tantum expiarit sceleris."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But these declamations, deriving as they do, to
begin with, from &AElig;schylus,<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> are seen from their
very recurrence in Seneca to have become stock
speeches for the ancient tragic drama; and they
were clearly well-fitted to become so for the
medi&aelig;val. The phrases used were already
classic when Catullus employed them before
Seneca:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Suscipit, O Gelli, quantum non ultima Thetys</span>
<span class="i0">Non genitor Nympharum, abluit Oceanus."<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>In the Renaissance we find the theme reproduced
by Tasso;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> and it had doubtless been
freely used by Shakspere's English predecessors
and contemporaries. What he did was but to
set the familiar theme to a rhetoric whose
superb sonority must have left theirs tame, as
it leaves Seneca's stilted in comparison. Marston
did his best with it, in a play which may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>have been written before, though published
after, <span class="smcap">Macbeth</span><a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Although the waves of all the Northern sea</span>
<span class="i0">Should flow for ever through those guilty hands,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet the sanguinolent stain would extant be"</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&mdash;a sad foil to Shakspere's</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The multitudinous seas incarnadine."</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is very clear, then, that we are not here
entitled to suppose Shakspere a reader of the
Senecan tragedies; and even were it otherwise,
the passage in question is a figure of speech
rather than a reflection on life or a stimulus to
such reflection. And the same holds good of
the other interesting but inconclusive parallels
drawn by Dr. Cunliffe. Shakspere's</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6_5">"Diseases desperate grown</span>
<span class="i0">By desperate appliance are relieved,</span>
<span class="i0">Or not at all,"<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span>
</div>
</div>
<p>which he compares with Seneca's</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Et ferrum et ignis s&aelig;pe medicin&aelig; loco est.</span>
<span class="i0">Extrema primo nemo tentavit loco,"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>&mdash;a passage that may very well be the original
for the modern oracle about fire and iron&mdash;is
really much closer to the aphorism of Hippocra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>tes,
that "Extreme remedies are proper for
extreme diseases," and cannot be said to be
more than a proverb. In any case, it lay to
Shakspere's hand in Montaigne,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> as translated
by Florio:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To extreme sicknesses, extreme remedies."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Equally inconclusive is the equally close
parallel between Macbeth's</p>


<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and the sentence of Hercules:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i9">"Nemo polluto queat</span>
<span class="i0">Animo mederi."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>Such a reflection was sure to secure a proverbial
vogue, and in <span class="smcap">The Two Noble Kinsmen</span> (in
which Shakspere indeed seems to have had a
hand), we have the doctor protesting: "I think
she has a perturbed mind, which I cannot minister
to."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>And so, again, with the notable resemblance
between Hercules' cry:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Cur animam in ista luce detineam amplius,</span>
<span class="i0">Morerque, nihil est. Cuncta jam amisi bona,</span>
<span class="i0">Mentem, arma, famem, conjugam, natos, manus,</span>
<span class="i0">Etiam furorem."<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>
<p>and Macbeth's:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"I have lived long enough: my way of life</span>
<span class="i0">Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf;</span>
<span class="i0">And that which should accompany old age,</span>
<span class="i0">As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,</span>
<span class="i0">I must not look to have."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>Here there is indeed every appearance of imitation;
but, though the versification in Macbeth's
speech is certainly Shakspere's, such a
lament had doubtless been made in other
English plays, in direct reproduction of Seneca;
and Shakspere, in all probability, was again
only perfecting some previous declamation.</p>

<p>There is a quite proverbial quality, finally, in
such phrases as:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>&mdash;which might be traced to other sources nearer
Shakspere's hand than Seneca. And beyond
such sentences and such tropes as those above
considered, there was really little or nothing in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>the tragedies of Seneca to catch Shakspere's
eye or ear; nothing to generate in him a deep
philosophy of life or to move him to the manifold
play of reflection which gives his later
tragedies their commanding intellectuality.
Some such stimulus, as we have seen, he might
indeed have drawn from one or two of Seneca's
treatises, which do, in their desperately industrious
manner, cover a good deal of intellectual
ground, making some tolerable discoveries by
the way. But by the tests alike of quantity and
quality of reproduced matter, it is clear that the
indirect influence of the Senecan tragedies and
treatises on Shakspere was slight compared
with the direct influence of Montaigne's essays.
Nor is it hard to see why; even supposing Shakspere
to have had Seneca at hand in translation.
Despite Montaigne's own leaning to Seneca, as
compared with Cicero, we may often say of the
former what Montaigne says of the latter, that
"his manner of writing seemeth very tedious."
Over the <span class="smcap">De Beneficiis</span> and the <span class="smcap">De Ira</span> one is
sometimes moved to say, as the essayist does<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> over
Cicero, "I understand sufficiently what death
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>and voluptuousness are; let not a man busy himself
to anatomise them." For the swift and
penetrating flash of Montaigne, which either
goes to the heart of a matter once for all or
opens up a far vista of feeling and speculation,
leaving us newly related to our environment and
even to our experience, Seneca can but give us
a conscientious examination of the ground, foot
by foot, with a policeman's lantern, leaving us
consciously footsore, eyesore, and ready for bed.
Under no stress of satisfaction from his best
finds can we be moved to call him a man of
genius, which is just what we call Montaigne
after a few pages. It is the broad difference
between industry and inspiration, between
fecundity and pregnancy, between Jonson and
Shakspere. And, though a man of genius is
not necessarily dependent on other men of
genius for stimulus, we shall on scrutiny find
reason to believe that in Shakspere's case the
nature of the stimulus counted for a great deal.</p>

<p>Even before that is made clear, however, there
can be little hesitation about dismissing the
only other outstanding theory of a special intellectual
influence undergone by Shakspere&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
theory of Dr. Benno Tschischwitz, that he read
and was impressed by the Italian writings of
Giordano Bruno. In this case, the bases of the
hypothesis are of the scantiest and the flimsiest.
Bruno was in England from 1583 to 1586,
before Shakspere came to London. Among his
patrons were Sidney and Leicester, but neither
Southampton nor Pembroke. In all his writings
only one passage can be cited which even
faintly suggests a coincidence with any in
Shakspere; and in that the suggestion is faint
indeed. In Bruno's ill-famed comedy <span class="smcap">Il
Candelajo</span>, Octavio asks the pedant Manfurio,
"Che e la materia di vostri versi," and the
pedant replies, "Litter&aelig;, syllab&aelig;, dictio et
oratio, partes propinqu&aelig; et remot&aelig;," on which
Octavio again asks: "Io dico, quale e il suggetto
et il proposito."<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> So far as it goes this is
something of a parallel to Polonius's question to
Hamlet as to what he reads, and Hamlet's
answer, "Words, words." But the scene is
obviously a stock situation; and if there are any
passages in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> which clearly belong to the
pre-Shaksperean play, the fooling of Hamlet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>with Polonius is one of them. And beyond
this, Dr. Tschischwitz's parallels are flatly unconvincing,
or rather they promptly put themselves
out of court. He admits that nothing else
in Bruno's comedy recalls anything else in
Shakspere;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> but he goes on to find analogies
between other passages in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> and some of
Bruno's philosophic doctrines. Quoting Bruno's
theorem that all things are made up of indestructible
atoms, and that death is but a transformation,
Dr. Tschischwitz cites as a reproduction
of it Hamlet's soliloquy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, that this too, too solid flesh would melt!"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is difficult to be serious over such a contention;
and it is quite impossible for anybody out
of Germany or the Bacon-Shakspere party to
be as serious over it as Dr. Tschischwitz, who
finds that Hamlet's figure of the melting of flesh
into dew is an illustration of Bruno's "atomic
system," and goes on to find a further Brunonian
significance in Hamlet's jeering answers to the
king's demand for the body of Polonius. Of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>these passages he finds the source or suggestion
in one which he translates from Bruno's <span class="smcap">Cena
de le Ceneri</span>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"For to this matter, of which our planet is formed,
death and dissolution do not come; and the annihilation
of all nature is not possible; but it attains from
time to time, by a fixed law, to renew itself and to
change all its parts, rearranging and recombining them;
all this necessarily taking place in a determinate series,
under which everything assumes the place of another."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p></div>

<p>In the judgment of Dr. Tschischwitz, this
theorem, which anticipates so remarkably the
modern scientific conception of the universe,
"elucidates" Hamlet's talk about worms and
bodies, and his further sketch of the progress of
Alexander's dust to the plugging of a beer-barrel.
It seems unnecessary to argue that all
this is the idlest supererogation. The passages
cited from <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, all of them found in the
First Quarto, might have been drafted by a
much lesser man than Shakspere, and that
without ever having heard of Bruno or the
theory of the indestructibility of matter. There
is nothing in the case approaching to a reproduction
of Bruno's far-reaching thought; while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>on the contrary the "leave not a wrack behind,"
in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>, is an expression which sets aside,
as if it were unknown, the conception of an endless
transmutation of matter, in a context where
the thought would naturally suggest itself to
one who had met with it. Where Hamlet is
merely sardonic in the plane of popular or at
least exoteric humour, Dr. Tschischwitz credits
him with pantheistic philosophy. Where, on
the other hand, Hamlet speaks feelingly and
ethically of the serious side of drunkenness,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Dr.
Tschischwitz parallels the speech with a sentence
in the <span class="smcap">Bestia Trionfante</span>, which gives a merely
Rabelaisian picture of drunken practices.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Yet
again, he puts Bruno's large aphorism, "Sol et
homo generant hominem," beside Hamlet's gibe
about the sun breeding maggots in a dead dog&mdash;a
phrase possible to any euphuist of the
period. That the parallels amount at best to
little, Dr. Tschischwitz himself indirectly admits,
though he proceeds to a new extravagance of
affirmation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We do not maintain that such expressions are philosophemes,
or that Shakspere otherwise went any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>deeper into Bruno's system than suited his purpose, but
that such passages show Shakspere, at the time of his
writing of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, to have already reached the heights
of the thought of the age (Zeitbewusstsein), and to have
made himself familiar with the most abstract of the
sciences. Many hitherto almost unintelligible passages
in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> are now cleared up by the poet's acquaintance
with the atomic philosophy and the writings of the
Nolan."</p></div>

<p>All this belongs to the uncritical method of
the German Shakspere-criticism of the days
before R&uuml;melin. It is quite possible that Shakspere
may have heard something of Bruno's
theories from his friends; and we may be sure
that much of Bruno's teaching would have profoundly
interested him. If Bruno's lectures at
Oxford on the immortality of the soul included
the matter he published later on the subject,
they may have called English attention to the
Pythagorean lore concerning the fate of the soul
after death,<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> above cited from Montaigne. We
might again, on Dr. Tschischwitz's lines, trace
the verses on the "shaping fantasies" of "the
lunatic, the lover, and the poet," in the <span class="smcap">Midsummer
Night's Dream</span>,<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> to such a passage in
Bruno as this:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"The first and most capital painter is the vivacity of
the phantasy; the first and most capital poet is the
inspiration that originally arises with the impulse of
deep thought, or is set up by that, through the divine
or akin-to-divine breath of which they feel themselves
moved to the fit expression of their thoughts. For each
it creates the other principle. Therefore are the philosophers
in a certain sense painters; the poets, painters
and philosophers; the painters, philosophers and poets:
true poets, painters, and philosophers love and reciprocally
admire each other. There is no philosopher who
does not poetise and paint. Therefore is it said, not
without reason: To understand is to perceive the
figures of phantasy, and understanding is phantasy, or
is nothing without it."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p></div>

<p>But since Shakspere does not recognisably
echo a passage which he would have been
extremely likely to produce in such a context,
had he known it, we are bound to decide that he
had not even heard it cited, much less read it.
And so with any other remote resemblances
between his work and that of any author whom
he may have read. In regard even to passages
in Shakspere which come much nearer their
originals than any of these above cited come to
Bruno, we are forced to decide that Shakspere
got his thought at second or third hand. Thus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>the famous passage in <span class="smcap">Henry V.</span>,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> in which the
Archbishop figures the State as a divinely
framed harmony of differing functions, is clearly
traceable to Plato's <span class="smcap">Republic</span> and Cicero's <span class="smcap">De
Republica</span>; yet rational criticism must decide
with M. Stapfer<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> that Shakspere knew neither
of these treatises, but got his suggestion from
some English translation or citation.</p>

<p>In fine, we are constrained by all our knowledge
concerning Shakspere, as well as by the
abstract principles of proof, to regard him in
general as a reader of his own language only,
albeit not without a smattering of others; and
among the books in his own language which
we know him to have read in, and can prove him
to have been influenced by, we come back to
Montaigne's Essays, as by far the most important
and the most potential for suggestion and
provocation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>
<h3>IV.</h3>


<p>To have any clear idea, however, of what Montaigne
did or could do for Shakspere, we must
revise our conception of the poet in the light of
the positive facts of his life and circumstances&mdash;a
thing made difficult for us in England
through the transcendental direction given to
our Shakspere lore by those who first shaped it
sympathetically, to wit, Coleridge and the
Germans. An adoring idea of Shakspere,
as a mind of unapproachable superiority,
has thus become so habitual with most of
us that it is difficult to reduce our
notion to terms of normal individuality,
of character and mind as we know them
in life. When we read Coleridge, Schlegel, and
Gervinus, or even the admirable essay of
Charles Lamb, or the eloquent appreciations of
Mr. Swinburne, or such eulogists as Hazlitt and
Knight, we are in a world of abstract &aelig;sthetics
or of abstract ethics; we are not within sight of
the man Shakspere, who became an actor for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
livelihood in an age when the best actors played
in inn-yards for rude audiences, mostly illiterate
and not a little brutal; then added to his craft
of acting the craft of play-patching and refashioning;
who had his partnership share of
the pence and sixpences paid by the mob of
noisy London prentices and journeymen and
idlers that filled the booth theatre in which his
company performed; who sued his debtors rigorously
when they did not settle-up; worked up
old plays or took a hand in new, according as
the needs of his concern and his fellow-actors
dictated; and finally went with his carefully
collected fortune to spend his last years in ease
and quiet in the country town in which he was
born. Our sympathetic critics, even when, like
Dr. Furnivall, they know absolutely all the
arch&aelig;ological facts as to theatrical life in Shakspere's
time, do not seem to bring those facts
into vital touch with their &aelig;sthetic estimate of
his product; they remain under the spell of
Coleridge and Gervinus.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Emerson, it is true,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>protested at the close of his essay that he "could
not marry this fact," of Shakspere's being a
jovial actor and manager, "to his verse;" but
that deliverance has served only as a text for
those who have embraced the fantastic tenet that
Shakspere was but the theatrical agent and
representative of Bacon; a delusion of which the
vogue may be partly traced to the lack of psychological
solidity in the ordinary presentment
of Shakspere by his admirers. The heresy, of
course, merely leaps over the difficulty, into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>absolute irrelevance. Emerson was intellectually
to blame in that, seeing as he did the
hiatus between the poet's life and the prevailing
conception of his verse, he did not try to conceive
it all anew, but rather resigned himself to
the solution that Shakspere's mind was out of
human ken. "A good reader can in a sort
nestle into Plato's brain and think from thence,"
he said; "but not into Shakspere's; we are
still out of doors." We should indeed remain
so for ever did we not set about patiently picking
the locks where the transcendentalist has
dreamily turned away.</p>

<p>It is imperative that we should recommence
vigilantly with the concrete facts, ignoring all
the merely &aelig;sthetic and metaphysic syntheses.
Where Coleridge and Schlegel more or less ingeniously
invite us to acknowledge a miraculous
artistic perfection, where Lamb more movingly
gives forth the intense vibration aroused in his
spirit by Shakspere's ripest work, we must
turn back to track down the youth from Stratford;
son of a burgess once prosperous, but
destined to sink steadily in the world; married
at eighteen, under pressure of circumstances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
with small prospect of income, to the woman of
twenty-five; ill at ease in that position; and
at length, having made friends with a travelling
company of actors, come to London to earn a
living in any tolerable way by means of his
moderate education, his "small Latin and less
Greek," his knack of fluent rhyming, and his
turn for play-acting. To know him as he began
we must measure him narrowly by his first performances.
These are not to be looked for in
even the earliest of his plays, not one of which
can be taken to represent his young and unaided
faculty, whether as regards construction
or diction. Collaboration, the natural resort of
the modern dramatist, must have been to some
extent forced on him in those years by the
nature of his situation; and after all that has
been said by adorers of the quality of his wit and
his verse in such early comedies as <span class="smcap">Love's
Labour Lost</span> and <span class="smcap">The Two Gentlemen of
Verona</span>, the critical reader is apt to be left
pretty evenly balanced between the two reflections
that the wit and the versification have indeed
at times a certain happy naturalness of
their own, and that nevertheless, if they really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
be Shakspere's throughout, the most remarkable
thing in the matter is his later progress.
But even apart from such disputable issues, we
may safely say with Mr. Fleay that "there is
not a play of his that can be referred even on
the rashest conjecture to a date anterior to 1594,
which does not bear the plainest internal evidence
of having been refashioned at a later
time."<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> These plays, then, with all their evidences
of immaturity, of what Mr. Bagehot
called "clever young-mannishness," cannot serve
us as safe measures of Shakspere's mind at the
beginning of his career.</p>

<p>But it happens that we have such a measure
in performances which, since they imply no technical
arrangement, are of a homogenous literary
substance, and can be shown to be the work of a
man brought up in the Warwickshire dialect,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>
are not even challenged, I believe, by the adherents
of the Baconian faith. The tasks which
the greatest of our poets set himself when near
the age of thirty, and to which he presumably
brought all the powers of which he was then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>conscious, were the uninspired and pitilessly
prolix poems of <span class="smcap">Venus and Adonis</span> and <span class="smcap">The
Rape of Lucrece</span>, the first consisting of some
1,200 lines and the second of more than 1,800;
one a calculated picture of female concupiscence
and the other a still more calculated picture of
female chastity: the two alike abnormally
fluent, yet external, unimpassioned, endlessly
descriptive, elaborately unimpressive. Save for
the sexual attraction of the subjects, on the commercial
side of which the poet had obviously
reckoned in choosing them, these performances
could have no unstudious readers in our day
and few warm admirers in their own, so little
sign do they give of any high poetic faculty
save the two which singly go so often without
any determining superiority of mind&mdash;inexhaustible
flow of words and endless observation
of concrete detail. Of the countless thrilling
felicities of phrase and feeling for which Shakspere
is renowned above all English poets, not
one, I think, is to be found in those three
thousand fluently-scanned and smoothly-worded
lines: on the contrary, the wearisome succession
of stanzas, stretching the succinct themes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
immeasurably beyond all natural fitness and all
narrative interest, might seem to signalise such
a lack of artistic judgment as must preclude all
great performance; while the apparent plan of
producing an effect by mere multiplication of
words, mere extension of description without intension
of idea, might seem to prove a lack of
capacity for any real depth of passion. They
were simply manufactured poems, consciously
constructed for the market, the first designed at
the same time to secure the patronage of the
M&aelig;cenas of the hour, Lord Southampton, to
whom it was dedicated, and the second produced
and similarly dedicated on the strength of the
success of the first. The point here to be noted
is that they gained the poet's ends. They succeeded
as saleable literature, and they gained
the Earl's favour.</p>

<p>And the rest of the poet's literary career, from
this point forward, seems to have been no less
prudently calculated. Having plenty of evidence
that men could not make a living by
poetry, even if they produced it with facility;
and that they could as little count on living
steadily by the sale of plays, he joined with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
trade of actor the business not merely of playwright
but of part-sharer in the takings of the
theatre. The presumption from all we know
of the commercial side of the play-making of the
times is that, for whatever pieces Shakspere
touched up, collaborated in, or composed for his
company, he received a certain payment once for
all;<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> since there was no reason why his partners
should treat his plays differently in this regard
from the plays they bought of other men.
Doubtless, when his reputation was made, the
payments would be considerable. But the main
source of his income, or rather of the accumulations
with which he bought land and house and
tithes at Stratford, must have been his share in
the takings of the theatre&mdash;a share which would
doubtless increase as the earlier partners disappeared.
He must have speedily become the
principal man in the firm, combining as he did
the work of composer, reviser, and adaptor of
plays with that of actor and working partner.
We are thus dealing with a temperament or
mentality not at all obviously original or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>masterly, not at all conspicuous at the outset for
intellectual depth or seriousness, not at all
obtrusive of its "mission;" but exhibiting
simply a gift for acting, an abundant faculty of
rhythmical speech, and a power of minute observation,
joined with a thoroughly practical or
commercial handling of the problem of life, in a
calling not usually taken-to by commercially-minded
men. What emerges for us thus far is
the conception of a very plastic intelligence, a
good deal led and swayed by immediate circumstances;
but at bottom very sanely related to life,
and so possessing a latent faculty for controlling
its destinies; not much cultured, not profound,
not deeply passionate; not particularly reflective
though copious in utterance; a personality
which of itself, if under no pressure of pecuniary
need, would not be likely to give the world any
serious sign of mental capacity whatever.</p>

<p>In order, then, that such a man as this should
develop into the Shakspere of the great tragedies
and tragic comedies, there must concur two
kinds of life-conditions with those already noted&mdash;the
fresh conditions of deeply-moving experience
and of deep intellectual stimulus. Without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
these, such a mind would no more arrive at the
highest poetic and dramatic capacity than, lacking
the spur of necessity or of some outside call,
it would be moved to seek poetic and dramatic
utterance for its own relief. There is no sign
here of an innate burden of thought, bound to
be delivered; there is only the sensitive plate
or responsive faculty, capable of giving back
with peculiar vividness and spontaneity every
sort of impression which may be made on it.
The faculty, in short, which could produce those
3,000 fluent lines on the bare data of the stories
of Venus and Adonis and Tarquin and Lucrece,
with only the intellectual material of a rakish
Stratford lad's schooling and reading, and the
culture coming of a few years' association with
the primitive English stage and its hangers-on,
was capable of broadening and deepening, with
vital experience and vital culture, into the poet
of <span class="smcap">Lear</span> and <span class="smcap">Macbeth</span>. But the vital culture
must come to it, like the experience: this was
not a man who would go out of his way to seek
the culture. A man so minded, a man who
would bear hardship in order to win knowledge,
would not have settled down so easily into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
actor-manager with a good share in the company's
profits. There is almost nothing to show
that the young Shakspere read anything save
current plays, tales, and poems. Such a notable
book as North's <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>, published in 1579,
does not seem to have affected his literary
activity till about the year 1600: and even then
the subject of <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> may have been suggested
to him by some other play-maker, as was
the case with his chronicle histories. In his
contemporary, Ben Jonson, we do have the type
of the young man bent on getting scholarship
as the best thing possible to him. The bricklayer's
apprentice, unwillingly following the
craft of his stepfather, sticking obstinately all
the while to his Horace and his Homer, resolute
to keep and to add to the humanities he had
learned in the grammar school, stands out
clearly alongside of the other, far less enthusiastic
for knowledge and letters, but also far
more plastically framed, and at the same time
far more clearly alive to the seriousness of the
struggle for existence as a matter of securing the
daily bread-and-butter. It may be, indeed&mdash;who
knows&mdash;that but for that peculiarly early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
marriage, with its consequent family responsibilities,
Shakspere would have allowed himself
a little more of youthful breathing-time: it may
be that it was the existence of Ann Hathaway
and her three children that made him a seeker
for pelf rather than a seeker for knowledge in
the years between twenty and thirty, when the
concern for pelf sits lightly on most intellectual
men. The thesis undertaken in <span class="smcap">Love's Labour
Lost</span>&mdash;that the truly effective culture is that of
life in the world rather than that of secluded
study&mdash;perhaps expresses a process of inward and
other debate in which the wish has become
father to the thought. Scowled upon by jealous
collegians like Greene for presuming, actor as
he was, to write dramas, he must have asked
himself whether there was not something to be
gained from such schooling as theirs.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> But
then he certainly made more than was needed to
keep the Stratford household going; and the
clear shallow flood of <span class="smcap">Venus and Adonis</span> and
the <span class="smcap">Rape of Lucrece</span> stands for ever to show
how far from tragic consciousness was the young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>husband and father when close upon thirty years
old. It was in 1596 that his little Hamnet died
at Stratford; and there is nothing to show, says
Mr. Fleay,<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> that Shakspere had ever been there
in the interval between his departure in 1587
and the child's funeral.</p>

<p>But already, it may be, some vital experience
had come. Whatever view we take of the drama
of the sonnets, we may so far adopt Mr. Fleay's
remarkable theory<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> as to surmise that the
central episode of faithless love occurred about
1594. If so, here was enough to deepen and impassion
the plastic personality of the rhymer of
<span class="smcap">Venus and Adonis</span>; to add a new string to the
heretofore Mercurial lyre. All the while, too,
he was undergoing the kind of culture and of
psychological training involved in his craft of
acting&mdash;a culture involving a good deal of contact
with the imaginative literature of the Renaissance,
so far as then translated, and a psychological
training of great though little recognised
importance to the dramatist. It seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>obvious that the practice of acting, by a plastic
and receptive temperament, capable of manifold
appreciation, must have counted for much in developing
the faculties at once of sympathy and
expression. In this respect Shakspere stood
apart from his rivals, with their merely literary
training. And in point of fact, we do find in
his plays, year by year, a strengthening sense of
the realities of human nature, despite their frequently
idealistic method of portraiture, the
verbalism and factitiousness of much of their wit,
and their conventionality of plot. Above all
things, the man who drew so many fancifully
delightful types of womanhood must have been
intensely appreciative of the charm of sex;
and it is on that side that we are to look for his
first contacts with the deeper forces of life.
What marks off the Shakspere of thirty-five, in
fine, from all his rivals, is just his peculiarly
true and new<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> expression of the living grace of
womanhood, always, it is true, abstracted to the
form of poetry and skilfully purified from the
blemishes of the actual, but none the less con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>vincing
and stimulating. We are here in
presence at once of a rare receptive faculty and
a rare expressive faculty: the plastic organism
of the first poems touched through and through
with a hundred vibrations of deeper experience;
the external and extensive method gradually
ripening into an internal and intensive; the
innate facility of phrase and alertness of attention
turned from the physical to the psychical.
But still it is to the psychics of sex, for the
most part, that we are limited. Of the deeps of
human nature, male nature, as apart from the
love of woman, the playwright still shows no
special perception, save in the vivid portrait of
Shylock, the exasperated Jew. The figures in
which we can easily recognise his hand in the
earlier historical plays are indeed marked by his
prevailing sanity of perception; always they
show the play of the seeing eye, the ruling
sense of reality which shaped his life; it is this
visible actuality that best marks them off from
the non-Shaksperean figures around them.
And in the wonderful figures of Falstaff and his
group we have a roundness of comic reality to
which nothing else in modern literature thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
far could be compared. But still this, the most
remarkable of all, remains comic reality; and,
what is more, it is a comic reality of which, as
in the rest of his work, the substratum was pre-Shaksperean.
For it is clear that the figure of
Falstaff, as Oldcastle, had been popularly successful
before Shakspere took hold of it:<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> and
what he did here, as elsewhere, with his uninventive
mind, in which the faculty of imagination
always rectified and expanded rather than
originated types and actions, was doubtless to
give the hues and tones of perfect life to the
half-real inventions of others. This must
always be insisted on as the special psychological
characteristic of Shakspere. Excepting in the
doubtful case of <span class="smcap">Love's Labour Lost</span>, he never
invented a plot; his male characters are almost
always developments from an already sketched
original; it is in drawing his heroines, where he
is most idealistic, that he seems to have been
most independently creative, his originals here
being doubtless the women who had charmed
him, set living in ideal scenes to charm others.
And it resulted from this specialty of structure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>that the greater reality of his earlier male historic
figures, as compared with those of most of
his rivals, is largely a matter of saner and more
felicitous declamation&mdash;the play of his great and
growing faculty of expression&mdash;since he had no
more special knowledge of the types in hand
than had his competitors. It is only when his
unequalled receptive faculty has been acted upon
by a peculiarly concentrated and readily assimilated
body of culture, the English translation by
Sir Thomas North of Amyot's French translation
of Plutarch's Lives, that we find Shakspere
incontestably superior to his contemporaries
in the virile treatment of virile problems
no less than in the sympathetic rendering of
emotional charm and tenderness and the pathos
of passion. The tragedy of <span class="smcap">Romeo and Juliet</span>,
with all its burning fervours and swooning
griefs, remains for us a picture of the luxury of
woe: it is truly said of it that it is not fundamentally
unhappy. But in <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> we
have touched a further depth of sadness. For
the moving tragedy of circumstance, of lovers
sundered by fate only to be swiftly joined in
exultant death, we have the profounder tragedy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of mutually destroying energies, of grievously
miscalculating men, of failure and frustration
dogging the steps of the strenuous and the wise,
of destiny searching out the fatal weakness of
the strong. To the poet has now been added the
reader; to the master of the pathos of passion the
student of the tragedy of universal life. It is
thus by culture and experience&mdash;culture limited
but concentrated, and experience limited but
intense&mdash;that the man Shakspere has been
intelligibly made into the dramatist Shakspere
as we find him when he comes to his greatest
tasks. For the formation of the supreme artist
there was needed alike the purely plastic organism
and the special culture to which it was so
uniquely fitted to respond; culture that came
without search, and could be undergone as spontaneously
as the experience of life itself; knowledge
that needed no more wooing than Ann
Hathaway, or any dubious angel in the sonnets.
In the English version of Plutarch's <span class="smcap">Lives</span>,
pressed upon him doubtless by the play-making
plans of other men, Shakspere found the most
effectively concentrated history of ancient humanity
that could possibly have reached him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
and he responded to the stimulus with all his
energy of expression because he received it so
freely and vitally, in respect alike of his own
plasticity and the fact that the vehicle of the
impression was his mother tongue. It is plain
that to the last he made no secondary study of
antiquity. He made blunders which alone
might warn the Baconians off their vain quest:
he had no notion of chronology: finding Cato
retrospectively spoken of by Plutarch as one
to whose ideal Coriolanus had risen, he makes a
comrade of Coriolanus say it, as if Cato were a
dead celebrity in Coriolanus' day; just as he
makes Hector quote Aristotle in Troy. These
clues are not to be put aside with &aelig;sthetic platitudes:
they are capital items in our knowledge
of the man. And if even the idolator feels perturbed
by their obtrusion, he has but to reflect
that where the trained scholars around Shakspere
reproduced antiquity with greater accuracy
in minor things, tithing the mint and anise
and cumin of erudition, they gave us of the
central human forces, which it was their special
business to realise, mere hollow and tedious
parodies. Jonson was a scholar whose variety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
of classic reading might have constituted him
a specialist to-day; but Jonson's ancients are
mostly dead for us, even as are Jonson's
moderns, because they are the expression of a
psychic faculty which could neither rightly perceive
reality, nor rightly express what it did perceive.
He represents industry in art without
inspiration. The two contrasted pictures, of
Jonson writing out his harangues in prose in
order to turn them into verse, and of Shakspere
giving his lines unblotted to the actors&mdash;speaking
in verse, in the white heat of his cerebration,
as spontaneously as he breathed&mdash;these historic
data, which happen to be among the most perfectly
certified that we possess concerning the
two men, give us at once half the secret of one
and all the secret of the other. Jonson had the
passion for book knowledge, the patience for
hard study, the faculty for plot-invention; and
withal he produced dramatic work which gives
little or no permanent pleasure. Shakspere
had none of these characteristics; and yet, being
the organism he was, it only needed the culture
which fortuitously reached him in his own
tongue to make him successively the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
dramatic master of eloquence, mirth, charm,
tenderness, passion, pathos, pessimism, and
philosophic serenity that literature can show,
recognisably so even though his work be almost
constantly hampered by the framework of
other men's enterprises, which he was so singularly
content to develop or improve. Hence the
critical importance of following up the culture
which evolved him, and above all, that which
finally touched him to his most memorable
performance.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>V.</h3>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>It is to Montaigne, then, that we now come,
in terms of our preliminary statement of evidence.
When Florio's translation was published,
in 1603, Shakspere was thirty-seven
years old, and he had written or refashioned
<span class="smcap">King John, Henry IV., The Merchant of
Venice, A Midsummer Night's Dream,
Richard II., Twelfth Night, As You Like
It, Henry V., Romeo and Juliet, The Merry
Wives of Windsor</span>, and <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span>. It is
very likely that he knew Florio, being intimate
with Jonson, who was Florio's friend and
admirer; and the translation, long on the stocks,
must have been discussed in his hearing. Hence,
presumably, his immediate perusal of it. Portions
of it he may very well have seen or heard
of before it was fully printed (necessarily a long
task in the then state of the handicraft); but in
the book itself, we have seen abundant reason to
believe, he read largely in 1603-4.</p>

<p>Having inductively proved the reading, and
at the same time the fact of the impression it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
made, we may next seek to realise deductively
what kind of impression it was fitted to make.
We can readily see what North's Plutarch could
be and was to the sympathetic and slightly-cultured
playwright; it was nothing short of a new
world of human knowledge; a living vision of
two great civilisations, giving to his universe a
vista of illustrious realities beside which the
charmed gardens of Renaissance romance and
the bustling fields of English chronicle-history
were as pleasant dreams or noisy interludes. He
had done wonders with the chronicles; but in
presence of the long muster-rolls of Greece and
Rome he must have felt their insularity; and he
never returned to them in the old spirit. But if
Plutarch could do so much for him, still greater
could be the service rendered by Montaigne.
The difference, broadly speaking, is very much
as the difference in philosophic reach between
<span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> and <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, between <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>
and <span class="smcap">Lear</span>.</p>

<p>For what was in its nett significance Montaigne's
manifold book, coming thus suddenly,
in a complete and vigorous translation, into
English life and into Shakspere's ken? Simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the most living book then existing in Europe.
This is not the place, nor am I the person, to
attempt a systematic estimate of the most enduring
of French writers, who has stirred to their
best efforts the ablest of French critics; but I
must needs try to indicate briefly, as I see it,
his significance in general European culture.
And I would put it that Montaigne is really, for
the civilised world at this day, what Petrarch
has been too enthusiastically declared to be&mdash;the
first of the moderns. He is so as against
even the great Rabelais, because Rabelais misses
directness, misses universality, misses lucidity,
in his gigantic mirth; he is so as against
Petrarch, because he is emphatically an impressionist
where Petrarch is a framer of studied
compositions; he is so against Erasmus, because
Erasmus also is a framer of artificial compositions
in a dead language, where Montaigne
writes with absolute spontaneity in a language
not only living but growing. Only Chaucer,
and he only in the Canterbury Tales, can be
thought of as a true modern before Montaigne;
and Chaucer is there too English to be significant
for all Europe. The high figure of Dante<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
is decisively medi&aelig;val: it is the central point in
medi&aelig;val literature. Montaigne was not only
a new literary phenomenon in his own day: he
remains so still; for his impressionism, which
he carried to such lengths in originating it, is
the most modern of literary inspirations; and all
our successive literary and artistic developments
are either phases of the same inspiration or
transient reactions against it. Where literature
in the mass has taken centuries to come within
sight of the secret that the most intimate form
of truth is the most interesting, he went, in his
one collection of essays, so far towards absolute
self-expression that our practice is still in the
rear of his, which is quite too unflinching for
contemporary nerves. Our <i>bonne foi</i> is still sophisticated
in comparison with that of the great
Gascon. Of all essayists who have yet written,
he is the most transparent, the most sincere even
in his stratagems, the most discursive, the most
free-tongued, and therefore the most alive. A
classic commonplace becomes in his hands a new
intimacy of feeling: where verbal commonplaces
have, as it were, glazed over the surface of our
sense, he goes behind them to rouse anew the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
living nerve. And there is no theme on which
he does not some time or other dart his sudden
and searching glance. It is truly said of him
by Emerson that "there have been men with
deeper insight; but, one would say, never a man
with such abundance of thoughts: he is never
dull, never insincere, and has the genius to
make the reader care for all that he cares for.
Cut these words and they bleed; they are vascular
and alive." Such a voice, speaking at Shakspere's
ear in an English nearly as racy and
nervous as the incomparable old-new French of
the original, was in itself a revelation.</p>

<p>I have said above that we seem to see passing
from Montaigne to Shakspere a vibration of
style as well as of thought; and it would be
difficult to overstate the importance of such an
influence. A writer affects us often more by the
pulse and pressure of his speech than by his
matter. Such an action is indeed the secret of
all great literary reputations; and in no author
of any age are the cadence of phrases and the
beat of words more provocative of attention than
in Montaigne. They must have affected Shakspere
as they have done so many others; and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
point of fact his work, from <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> forth,
shows a gain in nervous tension and pith, fairly
attributable to the stirring impact of the style
of Montaigne, with its incessancy of stroke, its
opulence of colour, its hardy freshness of figure
and epithet, its swift, unflagging stride. Seek
in any of Shakspere's plays for such a strenuous
rush of idea and rhythm as pulses through the
soliloquy:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How all occasions do inform against me,"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>and you will gather that there has been a technical
change wrought, no less than a moral and an
intellectual. The poet's nerves have caught a
new vibration.</p>

<p>But it was not merely a congenial felicity and
energy of utterance that Montaigne brought to
bear on his English reader, though the more we
consider this quality of spontaneity in the essayist
the more we shall realise its perennial fascination.
The culture-content of Montaigne's book
is more than even the self-revelation of an extremely
vivacious and reflective intelligence; it
is the living quintessence of all Latin criticism
of life, and of a large part of Greek; a quintessence
as fresh and pungent as the essay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>ist's expression
of his special individuality.
For Montaigne stands out among all the
humanists of the epochs of the Renaissance
and the Reformation in respect of the peculiar
directness of his contact with Latin literature.
Other men must have come to know Latin as
well as he; and hundreds could write it with an
accuracy and facility which, if he were ever
capable of it, he must, by his own confession,
have lost before middle life,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> though he read it
perfectly to the last. But he is the only modern
man whom we know to have learned Latin as a
mother tongue; and this fact was probably just
as important in psychology as was the similar
fact, in Shakspere's case, of his whole adult
culture being acquired in his own language. It
seems to me, at least, that there is something
significant in the facts: (1) that the man who
most vividly brought the spirit or outcome of
classic culture into touch with the general European
intelligence, in the age when the modern
languages first decisively asserted their birthright,
learned his Latin as a living and not as
a dead tongue, and knew Greek literature almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>solely by translation; (2) that the dramatist
who of all of his craft has put most of breathing
vitality into his pictures of ancient history,
despite endless inaccuracies of detail, read his
authorities only in his own language; and (3)
that the English poet who in our own century
has most intensely and delightedly sympathised
with the Greek spirit&mdash;I mean Keats&mdash;read his
Homer only in an English translation. As regards
Montaigne, the full importance of the fact
does not seem to me to have been appreciated by
the critics. Villemain, indeed, who perhaps
could best realise it, remarked in his youthful
&eacute;loge that the fashion in which the elder Montaigne
had his child taught Latin would bring
the boy to the reading of the classics with an
eager interest where others had been already
fatigued by the toil of grammar; but beyond
this the peculiarity of the case has not been
much considered. Montaigne, however, gives
us details which seem full of suggestion to
scientific educationists. "Without art, without
book, without grammar or precept, without
whipping, without tears, I learned a Latin as
pure as my master could give;" and his first<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
exercises were to turn bad Latin into good.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> So
he read his Ovid's Metamorphoses at seven or
eight, where other forward boys had the native
fairy tales; and a wise teacher led him later
through Virgil and Terence and Plautus and the
Italian poets in the same freedom of spirit.
Withal, he never acquired any facility in
Greek,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> and, refusing to play the apprentice
where he was accustomed to be master,<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> he declined
to construe in a difficult tongue; read his
Plutarch in Amyot; and his Plato, doubtless, in
the Latin version. It all goes with the peculiar
spontaneity of his mind, his reactions, his style;
and it was in virtue of this undulled spontaneity
that he was fitted to be for Shakspere, as he has
since been for so many other great writers, an
intellectual stimulus unique in kind and in
potency.</p>

<p>This fact of Montaigne's peculiar influence on
other spirits, comparatively considered, may
make it easier for some to conceive that his influence
on Shakspere could be so potent as has
been above asserted. Among those whom we
know him to have acted upon in the highest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>degree&mdash;setting aside the disputed case of Bacon&mdash;are
Pascal, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Flaubert,
Emerson, and Thoreau. In the case of Pascal,
despite his uneasy assumption that his philosophy
was contrary to Montaigne's, the influence
went so far that the <i>Pens&eacute;es</i> again and again
set forth Pascal's doctrine in passages taken
almost literally from the <span class="smcap">Essays</span>. Stung by the
lack of all positive Christian credence in Montaigne,
Pascal represents him as "putting all
things in doubt;" whereas it is just by first
putting all things in doubt that Pascal justifies
his own credence. The only difference is that
where Montaigne, disparaging the powers of
reason by the use of that very reason, used his
"doubt" to defend himself alike against the
atheists and the orthodox Christians, Catholic
or Protestant, himself standing simply to the
classic theism of antiquity, Pascal seeks to demolish
the theists with the atheists, falling back
on the Christian faith after denying the capacity
of the human reason to judge for itself. The
two procedures were of course alike fallacious;
but though Pascal, the more austere thinker of
the two, readily saw the invalidity of Mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>taigne's
as a defence of theism, he could do no
more for himself than repeat the process, disparaging
reason in the very language of the essayist,
and setting up in his turn his private predilection
in Montaigne's manner. In sum, his
philosophy is just Montaigne's, turned to the
needs of a broken spirit instead of a confident
one&mdash;to the purposes of a chagrined and exhausted
convertite instead of a theist of the
stately school of Cicero and Seneca and Plutarch.
Without Montaigne, one feels, the <i>Pens&eacute;es</i>
might never have been written: they represent
to-day, for all vigilant readers, rather the
painful struggles of a wounded intelligence to
fight down the doubts it has caught from contact
with other men's thought than any coherent
or durable philosophic construction.</p>

<p>It would be little more difficult to show the
debt of the <i>Esprit des Lois</i> to Montaigne's
inspiration, even if we had not Montesquieu's
avowal that "In most authors I see the man who
writes: in Montaigne, the man who thinks."<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>
That is precisely Montaigne's significance, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>sociology as in philosophy. His whole activity
is a seeking for causes; and in the very act of
undertaking to "humble reason" he proceeds
to instruct and re-edify it by endless corrective
comparison of facts. To be sure, he departed so
far from his normal <i>bonne foi</i> as to affect to
think there could be no certainties while parading
a hundred of his own, and with these some
which were but pretences; and his pet doctrine of
daimonic fortune is not ostensibly favourable to
social science; but in the concrete, he is more of a
seeker after rational law than any humanist of
his day. In discussing sumptuary laws, he
anticipates the economics of the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, as in discussing ecclesiastical
law he anticipates the age of tolerance;
in discussing criminal law, the work of Beccaria;
in discussing <i>&agrave; priori</i> science, the protest
of Bacon; and in discussing education,
many of the ideas of to-day. And it would be
difficult to cite, in humanist literature before our
own century, a more comprehensive expression of
the idea of natural law than this paragraph of
the <span class="smcap">Apology</span>:</p>

ourselves?"<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p></div>

<p>All this, of course, has a further bearing than
Montaigne gives it in the context, and affects his
own professed theology as it does the opinions
he attacks; but none the less, the passage strikes
at the dogmatists and the pragmatists of all the
preceding schools, and hardily clears the ground
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>for a new inductive system. And in the last
essay of all he makes a campaign against bad
laws, which unsays many of his previous sayings
on the blessedness of custom.</p>

<p>In tracing his influence elsewhere, it would be
hard to point to an eminent French prose-writer
who has not been affected by him. Sainte-Beuve
finds<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> that La Bruy&egrave;re "at bottom is close to
Montaigne, in respect not only of his style and
his skilfully inconsequent method, but of his way
of judging men and life"; and the literary
heredity from Montaigne to Rousseau is recognised
by all who have looked into the matter.
The temperaments are profoundly different; yet
the style of Montaigne had evidently taken as
deep a hold of the artistic consciousness of Rousseau
as had the doctrines of the later writers on
whom he drew for his polemic. But indeed he
found in the essay on the Cannibals the very
theme of his first paradox; in Montaigne's emphatic
denunciations<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> of laws more criminal
than the crimes they dealt with, he had a deeper
inspiration still; in the essay on the training
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>of children he had his starting-points for the
argumentation of <i>Emile</i>; and in the whole unabashed
self-portraiture of the <span class="smcap">Essays</span> he had his
great exemplar for the <i>Confessions</i>. Even in
the very different case of Voltaire, we may go at
least as far as Villemain and say that the essayist
must have helped to shape the thought of the
great freethinker; whose <i>Philosophe Ignorant</i>
may indeed be connected with the <span class="smcap">Apology</span>
without any of the hesitation with which Villemain
suggests his general parallel. In fine,
Montaigne has scattered his pollen over all the
literature of France. The most typical thought
of La Rochefoucauld is thrown out<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> in the
essay<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> <i>De l'utile et de l'honneste</i>; and the most
modern-seeming currents of thought, as M. Stapfer
remarks, can be detected in the passages of
the all-discussing Gascon.</p>

<p>Among English-speaking writers, to say
nothing of those who, like Sterne and Lamb,
have been led by his example to a similar felicity
of freedom in style, we may cite Emerson as one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>whose whole work is coloured by Montaigne's
influence, and Thoreau as one who, specially developing
one side of Emerson's gospel, may be
said to have found it all where Emerson found it,
in the Essay on Solitude.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> The whole doctrine
of intellectual self-preservation, the ancient thesis
"flee from the press and dwell in soothfastness,"
is there set forth in a series of ringing sentences,
most of which, set in Emerson or Thoreau, would
seem part of their text and thought. That this
is no random attribution may be learned from
the lecture on "Montaigne: the Sceptic," which
Emerson has included in his <span class="smcap">Representative
Men</span>. "I remember," he says, telling how in
his youth he stumbled on Cotton's translation,
"I remember the delight and wonder in which I
lived with it. It seemed to me as if I had myself
written the book in some former life, so sincerely
it spoke to my thought and experience."
That is just what Montaigne has done for a
multitude of others, in virtue of his prime
quality of spontaneous self-expression. As
Sainte-Beuve has it, there is a Montaigne in all
of us. Flaubert, we know, read him constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>for style; and no less constantly "found himself"
in the self-revelation and analysis of the
essays.</p>

<p>After all these testimonies to Montaigne's
seminal virtue, and after what we have seen of
the special dependence of Shakspere's genius
on culture and circumstance, stimulus and initiative,
for its evolution, there can no longer seem
to an open mind anything of mere paradox in
the opinion that the essays are the source of the
greatest expansive movement of the poet's mind,
the movement which made him&mdash;already a
master of the whole range of passional emotion,
of the comedy of mirth and the comedy and
tragedy of sex&mdash;the great master of the tragedy
of the moral intelligence. Taking the step from
<span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> to <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> as corresponding to
this movement in his mind, we may say that
where the first play exhibits the concrete perception
of the fatality of things, "the riddle of
the painful earth"; in the second, in its final
form, the perception has emerged in philosophic
consciousness as a pure reflection. The poet
has in the interim been revealed to himself;
what he had perceived he now conceives. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
this is the secret of the whole transformation
which the old play of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> has received at his
hands. Where he was formerly the magical
sympathetic plate, receiving and rectifying and
giving forth in inspired speech every impression,
however distorted by previous instruments, that
is brought within the scope of its action, he is
now in addition the inward judge of it all, so
much so that the secondary activity tends to
overshadow the primary. The old <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, it
is clear, was a tragedy of blood, of physical
horror. The least that Shakspere, at this age,
could have done with it, would be to overlay
and transform the physical with moral perception;
and this has already been in part done in
the First Quarto form. The mad Hamlet and
the mad Ophelia, who had been at least as much
comic as tragic figures in the older play, are
already purified of that taint of their barbaric
birth, save in so far as Hamlet still gibes at
Polonius and jests with Ophelia in the primitive
fashion of the pretended madman seeking his
revenge. But the sense of the futility of the
whole heathen plan, of the vanity of the revenge
to which the Christian ghost hounds his son, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the moral void left by the initial crime and its
concomitants, not to be filled by any hecatomb of
slain wrongdoers&mdash;the sense of all this, which is
the essence of the tragedy, though so few critics
seem to see it, clearly emerges only in the
finished play. The dramatist is become the
chorus to his plot, and the impression it all
makes on his newly active spirit comes out in
soliloquy after soliloquy, which hamper as much
as they explain the action. In the old prose
story, the astute barbarian takes a curiously circuitous
course to his revenge, but at last attains
it. In the intermediate tragedy of blood, the
circuitous action had been preserved, and withal
the revenge was attained only in the general
catastrophe, by that daimonic "fortune" on
which Montaigne so often enlarges. For Shakspere,
then, with his mind newly at work in
reverie and judgment, where before it had been
but perceptive and reproductive, the theme was
one of human impotence, failure of will, weariness
of spirit in presence of over-mastering fate,
recoil from the immeasurable evil of the world.
Hamlet becomes the mouthpiece of the all-sympathetic
spirit which has put itself in his place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
as it had done with a hundred suggested types
before, but with a new inwardness of comprehension,
a self-consciousness added to the myriad-sided
consciousness of the past. Hence an involution
rather than an elucidation of the play.
There can be no doubt that Shakspere, in
heightening and deepening the theme, has obscured
it, making the scheming barbarian into
a musing pessimist, who yet waywardly plays the
mock-madman as of old, and kills the "rat"
behind the arras; doubts the Ghost while acting
on his message; philosophises with Montaigne
and yet delays his revenge in the spirit of the
Christianised savage, who fears to send the praying
murderer to heaven. There is no solution
of these anomalies: the very state of Shakspere's
consciousness, working in his subjective
way on the old material, made inevitable a
moral anachronism and contradiction, analogous
in its kind to the narrative anachronisms of his
historical plays. But none the less, this
tragedy, the first of the great group which above
all his other work make him immortal, remains
perpetually fascinating, by virtue even of that
"pale cast of thought" which has "sicklied it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
o'er" in the sense of making it too intellectual
for dramatic unity and strict dramatic success.
Between these undramatic, brooding soliloquies
which stand so aloof from the action, but dominate
the minds of those who read and meditate
the text, and the old sensational elements of
murder, ghost, fencing and killing, which hold
the interest of the crowd&mdash;between these constituents,
<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> remains the most familiar
Shaksperean play.</p>

<p>This very pre-eminence and permanence, no
doubt, will make many students still demur to
the notion that a determining factor in the framing
of the play was the poet's perusal of Montaigne's
essays. And it would be easy to overstate
that thesis in such a way as to make it
untrue. Indeed, M. Chasles has, to my thinking,
so overstated it. Had I come to his main
proposition before realising the infusion of Montaigne's
ideas in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, I think I should have
felt it to be as excessive in the opposite direction
as the proposition of Mr. Feis. Says M.
Chasles:<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>&mdash;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"This date of 1603 (publication of Florio's translation)
is instructive; the change in Shakspere's style dates
from this very year. Before 1603, imitation of
Petrarch, of Ariosto, and of Spenser is evident in his
work: after 1603, this coquettish copying of Italy has
disappeared; no more crossing rhymes, no more sonnets
and concetti. All is reformed at once. Shakspere,
who had hitherto studied the ancients only in the
fashion of the fine writers of modern Italy, ... now
seriously studies Plutarch and Sallust, and seeks of
them those great teachings on human life with which
the chapters of Michael Montaigne are filled. Is it not
surprising to see Julius C&aelig;sar and Coriolanus suddenly
taken up by the man who has just (tout &agrave; l'heure) been
describing in thirty-six stanzas, like Marini, the doves
of the car of Venus? And does not one see that he comes
fresh from the reading of Montaigne, who never ceased
to translate, comment, and recommend the ancients...?
The dates of Shakspere's <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>, <span class="smcap">Cleopatra</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span> are incontestable. These
dramas follow on from 1606 to 1608, with a rapidity
which proves the fecund heat of an imagination still
moved."</p></div>

<p>All this must be revised in the light of a more
correct chronology. Shakspere's <span class="smcap">Julius C&aelig;sar</span>
dates, not from 1604 but from 1600 or 1601,
being referred to in Weever's <span class="smcap">Mirror of Martyrs</span>,
published in 1601, to say nothing of the
reference in the third Act of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> itself,
where Polonius speaks of such a play. And,
even if it had been written in 1604, it would still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
be a straining of the evidence to ascribe its production,
with that of <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> and <span class="smcap">Antony
and Cleopatra</span>, to the influence of Montaigne,
when every one of these themes was sufficiently
obtruded on the Elizabethan theatre by North's
translation of Amyot's <span class="smcap">Plutarch</span>. Any one
who will compare <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span> with the translation
in North will see that Shakspere has followed
the text down to the most minute and
supererogatory details, even to the making of
blunders by putting the biographer's remarks
in the mouths of the characters. The comparison
throws a flood of light on Shakspere's mode
of procedure; but it tells us nothing of his perusal
of Montaigne. Rather it suggests a return
from the method of the revised <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, with its
play of reverie, to the more strictly dramatic
method of the chronicle histories, though with a
new energy and concision of presentment. The
real clue to Montaigne's influence on Shakspere
beyond <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, as we have seen, lies not
in the Roman plays, but in <span class="smcap">Measure for
Measure</span>.</p>

<p>There is a misconception involved, again, in
M. Chasles' picture of an abrupt transition from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Shakspere's fantastic youthful method to that
of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> and the Roman plays. He overlooks
the intermediate stages represented by such
plays as <span class="smcap">Romeo and Juliet</span>, <span class="smcap">Henry IV.</span>, <span class="smcap">King
John</span>, the <span class="smcap">Merchant of Venice</span>, and <span class="smcap">As You
Like It</span>, all of which exhibit a great advance on
the methods of <span class="smcap">Love's Labour Lost</span>, with its
rhymes and sonnets and "concetti." The leap
suggested by M. Chasles is exorbitant; such a
headlong development would be unintelligible.
Shakspere had first to come practically into
touch with the realities of life and character
before he could receive from Montaigne the full
stimulus he actually did undergo. Plastic as
he was, he none the less underwent a normal
evolution; and his early concreteness and
verbalism and externality had to be gradually
transmuted into a more inward knowledge of
life and art before there could be superimposed
on that the mood of the thinker, reflectively
aware of the totality of what he had passed
through.</p>

<p>Finally, the most remarkable aspect of Shakspere's
mind is not that presented by <span class="smcap">Coriolanus</span>
and <span class="smcap">Antony and Cleopatra</span>, which with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
all their intense vitality represent rather his
marvellous power of reproducing impressions
than the play of his own criticism on the general
problem of life. For the full revelation of this
we must look rather in the great tragedies,
notably in <span class="smcap">Lear</span>, and thereafter in the subsiding
movement of the later serious plays. There it
is that we learn to give exactitude to our conception
of the influence exerted upon him by
Montaigne, and to see that, even as in the cases of
Pascal and Montesquieu, Rousseau and Emerson,
what happened was not a mere transference or
imposition of opinions, but a living stimulus, a
germination of fresh intellectual life, which developed
under new forms. It would be strange
if the most receptive and responsive of all the
intelligences which Montaigne has touched
should not have gone on differentiating itself
from his.<br /><br /></p>

<h3>VI.</h3>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>What then is the general, and what the final
relation of Shakspere's thought to that of Montaigne?
How far did the younger man approve
and assimilate the ideas of the elder, how far did
he reject them, how far modify them? In some
respects this is the most difficult part of our
inquiry, were it only because Shakspere is
firstly and lastly a dramatic writer. But he is
not only that: he is at once the most subjective,
the most sympathetic, and the most self-witholding
of dramatic writers. Conceiving all situations,
all epochs, in terms of his own psychology,
he is yet the furthest removed from all dogmatic
design on the opinions of his listeners; and it is
only after a most vigilant process of moral logic
that we can ever be justified in attributing to
him this or that thesis of any one of his personages,
apart from the general ethical sympathies
which must be taken for granted. Much facile
propaganda has been made by the device of
crediting him in person with every religious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
utterance found in his plays&mdash;even in the portions
which analytical criticism proves to have
come from other hands. Obviously we must
look to his general handling of the themes with
which the current religion deals, in order to
surmise his attitude to that religion. And in
the same way we must compare his general
handling of tragic and moral issues, in order to
gather his general attitude to the doctrine of
Montaigne.</p>

<p>At the very outset, we must make a clean
sweep of the strange proposition of Mr. Jacob
Feis&mdash;that Shakspere deeply disliked the philosophy
of Montaigne, and wrote <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> to discredit
it. It is hard to realise how such a hopeless
misconception can ever have arisen in the
mind of anyone capable of making the historic
research on which Mr. Feis seeks to found his
assertion. If there were no other argument
against it, the bare fact that the tragedy of
<span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> existed before Shakspere, and that he
was, as usual, simply working over a play
already on the boards, should serve to dismiss
such a wild hypothesis. And from every other
point of view, the notion is equally preposterous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>No human being in Shakspere's day could have
gathered from <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> such a criticism of Montaigne
as Mr. Feis reads into it by means of
violences of interpretation which might almost
startle Mr. Donnelly. Even if they blamed
Hamlet for delaying his revenge, in the manner
of the ordinary critical moralist, they could not
possibly regard that delay as a kind of vice
arising from the absorption of Montaignesque
opinions. In the very year of the appearance of
Florio's folio, it was a trifle too soon to make the
assumption that Montaigne was demoralising
mankind, even if we assume Shakspere to have
ever been capable of such a judgment. And
that assumption is just as impossible as the
other. According to Mr. Feis, Shakspere detested
such a creed and such conduct as Hamlet's,
and made him die by poison in order to
show his abhorrence of them&mdash;this, when we
know Hamlet to have died by the poisoned foil
in the earlier play. On that view, Cordelia died
by hanging in order to show Shakspere's conviction
that she was a malefactor; and Desdemona
by stifling as a fitting punishment for
adultery. The idea is outside of serious discus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>sion.
Barely to assume that Shakspere held
Hamlet for a pitiable weakling is a sufficiently
shallow interpretation of the play; but to assume
that he made him die by way of condign
punishment for his opinions is merely ridiculous.
Once for all, there is absolutely nothing
in Hamlet's creed or conduct which Shakspere
was in a position to regard as open to his denunciation.
The one intelligible idea which Mr.
Feis can suggest as connecting Hamlet's conduct
with Montaigne's philosophy is that Montaigne
was a quietest, preaching and practising withdrawal
from public broils. But Shakspere's
own practice was on all fours with this. He
sedulously held aloof from all meddling in public
affairs; and as soon as he had gained a
competence he retired, at the age of forty-seven,
to Stratford-on-Avon. Mr. Feis's argument
brings us to the very crudest form of the good
old Christian verdict that if Hamlet had been a
good and resolute man he would have killed his
uncle out of hand, whether at prayers or anywhere
else, and would then have married
Ophelia, put his mother in a nunnery, and lived
happily ever after.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> And to that edifying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>assumption, Mr. Feis adds the fantasy that
Shakspere dreaded the influence of Montaigne
as a deterrent from the retributive slaughter of
guilty uncles by wronged nephews.</p>

<p>In the hands of Herr Stedefeld, who in 1871
anticipated Mr. Feis's view of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> as a
sermon against Montaigne, the thesis is not a
whit more plausible. Herr Stedefeld entitles
his book<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>: "Hamlet: a Drama-with-a-purpose
(<span class="smcap">Tendenzdrama</span>) opposing the sceptical and cosmopolitan
view of things taken by Michael de
Montaigne"; and his general position is that
Shakspere wrote the play as "the apotheosis of
a practical Christianity," by way of showing
how any one like Hamlet, lacking in Christian
piety, and devoid of faith, love, and hope, must
needs come to a bad end, even in a good cause.
We are not entitled to charge Herr Stedefeld's
thesis to the account of religious bias, seeing that
Mr. Feis in his turn writes from the standpoint
of a kind of Protestant freethinker, who sees in
Shakspere a champion of free inquiry against
the Catholic conformist policy of Montaigne;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>while strictly orthodox Christians have found
in Hamlet's various allusions to deity, and in his
"as for me, I will go pray," a proof alike of his
and of Shakspere's steadfast piety. Against
all such superficialities of exegesis alike our
safeguard must be a broad common-sense
induction.</p>

<p>We are entitled to say at the outset, then, only
this, that Shakspere at the time of working
over <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span> and <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span> in
1603-1604 had in his mind a great deal of the
reasoning in Montaigne's Essays; and that a
number of the speeches in the two plays reproduce
portions of what he had read. We are not
entitled to assume that these portions are
selected as being in agreement with Shakspere's
own views: we are here limited to saying
that he put certain of Montaigne's ideas or
statements in the mouths of his characters where
they would be appropriate. It does not follow
that he shared the feelings of Claudio as to the
possible life of the soul after death. And when
Hamlet says to Horatio, on the strangeness of
the scene with the Ghost:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"And therefore as a stranger give it welcome!</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
<span class="i0">There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</span>
<span class="i0">Than are dreamt of in our philosophy"&mdash;</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>though this may be said to be a summary of the
whole drift of Montaigne's essay,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> <span class="smcap">That it is
folly to refer truth or falsehood to our
sufficiency</span>; and though we are entitled to believe
that Shakspere had that essay or its thesis
in his mind, there is no reason to suppose that
the lines express Shakspere's own belief in ghosts.
Montaigne had indicated his doubts on that
head even in protesting against sundry denials
of strange allegations: and it is dramatically
fitting that Hamlet in the circumstances should
say what he does. On the other hand, when the
Duke in <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, playing the
part of a friar preparing a criminal for death,
gives Claudio a consolation which does not contain
a word of Christian doctrine, not a syllable
of sacrificial salvation and sacramental forgiveness,
we are entitled to infer from such a singular
negative phenomenon, if not that Shakspere
rejected the Christian theory of things, at
least that it formed no part of his habitual
thinking. It was the special business of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>Duke, playing in such a character, to speak to
Claudio of sin and salvation, of forgiveness and
absolution. Such a singular omission must at
least imply disregard on the part of the dramatist.
It is true that Isabella, pleading to
Angelo in the second Act, speaks as a believing
Christian on the point of forgiveness for sins;
and the versification here is quite Shaksperean.
But a solution of the anomaly is to be found
here as elsewhere in the fact that Shakspere
was working over an existing play;<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> and that
in ordinary course he would, if need were, put
the religious pleading of Isabella into his own
magistral verse just as he would touch up the
soliloquy of Hamlet on the question of killing
his uncle at prayers&mdash;a soliloquy which we
know to have existed in the earlier forms of the
play. The writer who first made Isabella plead
religiously with Angelo would have made the
Duke counsel Claudio religiously. The Duke's
speech, then, is to be regarded as Shakspere's
special insertion; and it is to be taken as negatively
exhibiting his opinions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>
<p>In the same way, the express withdrawal of
the religious note at the close of <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>&mdash;where
in the Second Quarto we have Shakspere
making the dying prince say "the rest is
silence" instead of "heaven receive my soul," as
in the First Quarto&mdash;may reasonably be taken
to express the same agnosticism on the subject
of a future life as is implied in the Duke's
speech to Claudio. It cannot reasonably be
taken to suggest a purpose of holding Hamlet
up to blame as an unbeliever, because Hamlet
is made repeatedly to express himself, in talk
and in soliloquy, as a believer in deity, in
prayer, in hell, and in heaven. These speeches
are mostly reproductions of the old play, the
new matter being in the nature of the pagan
allusion to the "divinity that shapes our ends."
What is definitely Shaksperean is just the
agnostic conclusion.</p>

<p>Did Shakspere, then, derive this agnosticism
from Montaigne? What were really Montaigne's
religious and philosophic opinions? We must
consider this point also with more circumspection
than has been shown by most of Montaigne's
critics. The habit of calling him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
"sceptic," a habit initiated by the Catholic
priests who denounced his heathenish use of the
term "Fortune," and strengthened by various
writers from Pascal to Emerson, is a hindrance
to an exact notion of the facts, inasmuch as the
word "sceptic" has passed through two phases
of significance, and may still have either. In
the original sense of the term, Montaigne is a
good deal of a "sceptic," because the main purport
of the <span class="smcap">Apology of Raimond Sebonde</span> appears
to be the discrediting of human reason all
round, and the consequent shaking of all
certainty. And this method strikes not only
indirectly but directly at the current religious
beliefs; for Montaigne indicates a lack of
belief in immortality,<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> besides repeatedly ignoring
the common faith where he would naturally
be expected to endorse it, as in the nineteenth
and fortieth essays hereinbefore cited, and in his
discussion of the Apology of Socrates. As is
complained by Dean Church:<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> "His views, both
of life and death, are absolutely and entirely un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>affected
by the fact of his profession to believe
the Gospel." That profession, indeed, partakes
rather obviously of the nature of his other
formal salutes<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> to the Church, which are such as
Descartes felt it prudent to make in a later
generation. His profession of fidelity to
Catholicism, again, is rather his way of showing
that he saw no superiority of reasonableness in
Protestantism, than the expression of any real
conformity to Catholic ideals; for he indicates
alike his aversion to heretic-hunting and his
sense of the folly of insisting on the whole body
of dogma. When fanatical Protestants, uncritical
of their own creed, affected to doubt the
sincerity of any man who held by Catholicism,
he was naturally piqued. But he was more
deeply piqued, as Naigeon has suggested, when
the few but keen freethinkers of the time treated
the <span class="smcap">Theologia Naturalis</span> of Sebonde, which
Montaigne had translated at his father's wish,
as a feeble and inconclusive piece of argumentation;
and it was primarily to retaliate on such
critics&mdash;who on their part no doubt exhibited
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>some ill-founded convictions while attacking
others&mdash;that he penned the <span class="smcap">Apology</span>, which assails
atheism in the familiar sophistical fashion,
but with a most unfamiliar energy and splendour
of style, as a manifestation of the foolish
pride of a frail and perpetually erring reason.
For himself, he was, as we have said, a classic
theist, of the school of Cicero and Seneca; and
as regards that side of his own thought he is not
at all sceptical, save in so far as he nominally
protested against all attempts to bring deity
down to human conceptions, while himself doing
that very thing, as every theist needs must.</p>

<p>Shakspere, then, could find in Montaigne the
traditional deism of the pagan and Christian
world, without any colour of specifically Christian
faith, and with a direct lead to unbelief in
a future state. But, whether we suppose
Shakspere to have been already led, as he
might be by the initiative of his colleague Marlowe,
an avowed atheist, to agnostic views on
immortality, or whether we suppose him to have
had his first serious lead to such thought from
Montaigne, we find him to all appearance carrying
further the initial impetus, and proceeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
from the serene semi-Stoicism of the essayist to
a deeper and sterner conception of things. It
lay, indeed, in the nature of Shakspere's psychosis,
so abnormally alive to all impressions, that
when he fully faced the darker sides of universal
drama, with his reflective powers at work, he
must utter a pessimism commensurate with the
theme. This is part, if not the whole, of the
answer to the question "Why did Shakspere
write tragedies?"<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> The whole answer can
hardly be either Mr. Spedding's, that the poet
wrote his darkest tragedies in a state of philosophic
serenity,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> or Dr. Furnivall's, that he
"described hell because he had felt hell."<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> But
when we find Shakspere writing a series of
tragedies, including an extremely sombre
comedy (<span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>), after having
produced mainly comedies and history-plays, we
must conclude that the change was made of his
own choice, and that whereas formerly his
theatre took its comedies mostly from him, and
its tragedies mostly from others, it now took its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>comedies mostly from others and its tragedies
from him. Further, we must assume that the
gloomy cast of thought so pervadingly given to
the new tragedies is partly a reflex of his own
experience, but also in large part an expression
of the philosophy to which he had been led by
his reading, as well as by his life. For we must
finally avow that the pervading thought in the
tragedies outgoes the simple artistic needs of the
case. In <span class="smcap">Othello</span> we have indeed a very
strictly dramatic array of the forces of wrong&mdash;weakness,
blind passion, and pitiless egoism;
but there is already a full suggestion of the overwhelming
energy of the element of evil; and in
<span class="smcap">Lear</span> the conception is worked out with a desperate
insistence which carries us far indeed
from the sunny cynicism and prudent scepticism
of Montaigne. Nowhere in the essays do we find
such a note of gloom as is struck in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"As flies to wanton boys are we to the Gods:</span>
<span class="i0">They kill us for their sport."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>And since there is no pretence of balancing that
mordant saying with any decorous platitude of
Christian Deism, we are led finally to the admission
that Shakspere sounded a further depth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of philosophy than Montaigne's unembittered
"cosmopolitan view of things." Instead of reacting
against Montaigne's "scepticism," as
Herr Stedefeld supposes, he produced yet other
tragedies in which the wrongdoers and the
wronged alike exhibit less and not more of
Christian faith than Hamlet,<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> and in which
there is no hint of any such faith on the part
of the dramatist, but, on the contrary, a sombre
persistence in the presentment of unrelieved evil.
The utterly wicked Iago has as much of religion
in his talk as anyone else in <span class="smcap">Othello</span>, using the
phrases "Christian and heathen," "God bless
the mark," "Heaven is my judge," "You are
one of those that will not serve God, if the devil
bid you," "the little godliness I have," "God's
will," and so forth; the utterly wicked Edmund
in <span class="smcap">Lear</span>, as we have seen, is made to echo Montaigne's
"sceptical" passage on the subject of
stellar influences, spoken with a moral purpose,
rather than the quite contrary utterance in the
<span class="smcap">Apology</span>, in which the essayist, theistically bent
on abasing human pretensions, gives to his
scepticism the colour of a belief in those very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>influences.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> There is here, clearly, no pro-religious
thesis. The whole drift of the play
shows that Shakspere shares the disbelief in stellar
control, though he puts the expression of the
disbelief in the mouth of a villain; though he
makes the honest Kent, on the other hand, declare
that "it is the stars ... that govern
our conditions;"<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> and though he had previously
made Romeo speak of "the yoke of inauspicious
stars," and the Duke describe mankind
as "servile to all the skiey influences," and
was later to make Prospero, in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span><a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>
express his belief in "a most auspicious star."
In the case of Montaigne, who goes on yet again
to contradict himself in the <span class="smcap">Apology</span> itself,
satirising afresh the habit of associating deity
with all human concerns, we are driven to surmise
an actual variation of opinion&mdash;the vivacious
intelligence springing this way or that
according as it is reacting against the atheists
or against the dogmatists. Montaigne, of
course, is not a coherent philosopher; the way
to systematic philosophic truth is a path too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>steep to be climbed by such an undisciplined
spirit as his, "sworn enemy to obligation, to
assiduity, to constancy";<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> and the net result
of his "Apology" for Raimond Sebonde is to upset
the system of that sober theologian as well
as all others. Whether Shakspere, on the other
hand, could or did detect all the inconsistencies
of Montaigne's reasoning, is a point on which
we are not entitled to more than a surmise; but
we do find that on certain issues on which Montaigne
dogmatises very much as did his predecessors,
Shakspere applies a more penetrating
logic, and explicitly reverses the essayist's verdicts.
Montaigne, for instance, carried away by
his master doctrine that we should live "according
to nature," is given to talking of "art"
and "nature" in the ordinary manner, carrying
the primitive commonplace indeed to the length
of a paradox. Thus in the essay on the Cannibals,<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>
speaking of "savages," he protests that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"They are even savage, as we call those fruits wild
which nature of herself and of her ordinary progress hath
produced, whereas indeed they are those which ourselves
have altered by our artificial devices, and
diverted from their common order, we should rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>call savage. In those are the true and more profitable
virtues and natural properties most lively and
vigorous;"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p></div>

<p>deciding with Plato that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"all things are produced either by nature, by fortune,
or by art; the greatest and fairest by one or other of
the two first; the least and imperfect by this last."</p></div>

<p>And in the <span class="smcap">Apology</span>,<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> after citing some as arguing
that</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Nature by a maternal gentleness accompanies and
guides" the lower animals, "as if by the hand, to all
the actions and commodities of their life," while, "as
for us, she abandons us to hazard and fortune, and to
seek by art the things necessary to our conservation,"</p></div>

<p>though he proceeds to insist on the contrary that
"nature has universally embraced all her creatures,"
man as well as the rest, and to argue
that man is as much a creature of nature as the
rest&mdash;since even speech, "if not natural, is
necessary"&mdash;he never seems to come within
sight of the solution that art, on his own showing,
is just nature in a new phase. But to that
point Shakspere proceeds at a stride in the
<span class="smcap">Winter's Tale</span>, one of the latest plays (? 1611),
written about the time when we know him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>have been reading or re-reading the essay on
the Cannibals. When Perdita refuses to plant
gillyflowers in her garden,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i7_5">"For I have heard it said</span>
<span class="i0">There is an art which in their piedness shares</span>
<span class="i0">With great creating nature,"</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>the old king answers:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"Say there be:</span>
<span class="i0">Yet nature is made better by no mean,</span>
<span class="i0">But nature makes that mean; so o'er that art</span>
<span class="i0">Which you say adds to nature, is an art</span>
<span class="i0">That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry</span>
<span class="i0">A gentle scion to the wildest stock</span>
<span class="i0">And make conceive a bark of baser kind</span>
<span class="i0">By bud of nobler race: This is an art</span>
<span class="i0">Which does mend nature&mdash;change it rather; but</span>
<span class="i0">The art itself is nature."<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is an analysis, a criticism, a philosophic
demonstration; and the subtle poet smilingly
lets us see immediately that he had tried the
argument on the fanatics of "nature," fair or
other, and knew them impervious to it. "I'll
not put," says Puritan Perdita, after demurely
granting that "so it is"&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"I'll not put</span>
<span class="i0">The dibble in earth to set one slip of them."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The mind which could thus easily pierce below
the inveterate fallacy of three thousand years of
conventional speech may well be presumed
capable of rounding Montaigne's philosophy
wherever it collapses, and of setting it aside
wherever it is arbitrary. Certain it is that we
can never convict Shakspere of bad reasoning
in person; and in his later plays we never seem
to touch bottom in his thought. The poet of
<span class="smcap">Venus and Adonis</span> seems to have deepened
beyond the plummet-reach even of the deep-striking
intelligence that first stirred him to
philosophise.</p>

<p>And yet, supposing this to be so, there is none
the less a lasting community of thought between
the two spirits, a lasting debt from the younger
to the elder. Indeed, we cannot say that at all
points Shakspere outwent his guide. It is a
curious reflection that they had probably one
foible in common; for we know Montaigne's
little weakness of desiring his family to be
thought ancient, of suppressing the fact of its
recent establishment by commerce; and we have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
evidence which seems to show that Shakspere
sought zealously,<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> despite rebuffs, the formal
constitution of a coat-of-arms for his family. On
the other hand, there is nothing in Shakspere's
work&mdash;the nature of the case indeed forbade it&mdash;to
compare in democratic outspokenness with
Montaigne's essay<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> <span class="smcap">Of the Inequality among
us</span>. The Frenchman's hardy saying<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> that
"the souls of emperors and cobblers are
all cast in one same mould" could not
well be echoed in Elizabethan drama; and
indeed we cannot well be sure that Shakspere
would have endorsed it, with his
fixed habit of taking kings and princes and
generals and rich ones for his personages. But
then, on the other hand, we cannot be sure that
this was anything more than a part of his deliberate
life's work of producing for the English
multitude what that multitude cared to see, and
catching London with that bait of royalty which
commonly attracted it. It remains a fine question
whether his extravagant idealisation and
justification of Henry V.&mdash;which, though it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>gives so little pause to some of our English
critics, entitled M. Guizot to call him a mere
John Bull in his ideas of international politics&mdash;it
remains disputable whether this was
exactly an expression of his own thought. It is
notable that he never again strikes the note of
blatant patriotism. And the poets of that time,
further, seem to have had their tongues very
much in their cheeks with regard to their
Virgin Queen; so that we cannot be sure that
Shakspere, paying her his fanciful compliment,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>
was any more sincere about it than Ben
Jonson, who would do as much while privately
accepting the grossest scandal concerning her.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>
It is certainly a remarkable fact that Shakspere
abstained from joining in the poetic out-cry
over her death, incurring reproof by his
silence.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>However all that may have been, we find
Shakspere, after his period of pessimism, viewing
life in a spirit which could be expressed in
terms of Montaigne's philosophy. He certainly
shaped his latter years in accordance with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>essayist's ideal. We can conceive of no other
man in Shakspere's theatrical group deliberately
turning his back, as he did, on the many-coloured
London life when he had means to
enjoy it at leisure, and seeking to possess his
own soul in Stratford-on-Avon, in the circle of
a family which had already lived so long without
him. But that retirement, rounding with
peace the career of manifold and intense experience,
is a main fact in Shakspere's life, and
one of our main clues to his innermost character.
Emerson, never quite delivered from Puritan
prepossessions, avowed his perplexity over the
fact "that this man of men, he who gave to the
science of mind a new and larger subject than
had ever existed, and planted the standard of
humanity some furlongs forward into Chaos&mdash;that
he should not be wise for himself: it must
even go into the world's history that the best
poet led an obscure (!) and profane life, using
his genius for the public amusement." If this
were fundamentally so strange a thing, one
might have supposed that the transcendentalist
would therefore "as a stranger give it welcome."
Approaching it on another plane, one finds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
nothing specially perplexing in the matter.
Shakspere's personality was an uncommon
combination; but was not that what should
have been looked for? And where, after all, is
the evidence that he was "not wise for himself"?<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>
Did he not make his fortune where
most of his rivals failed? If he was "obscure,"
how otherwise could he have been less so? How
could the bankrupt tradesman's son otherwise
rise to fame? Should he have sought, at all
costs, to become a lawyer, and rise perchance to
the seat of Bacon, and the opportunity of eking
out his stipend by bribes? If it be conceded
that he must needs try literature, and such
literature as a man could live by; and if it be
further conceded that his plays, being so marvellous
in their content, were well worth the
writing, where enters the "profanity" of having
written them, or of having acted in them, "for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>the public amusement"? Even wise men seem
to run special risks when they discourse on
Shakspere: Emerson's essay has its own
anomaly.</p>

<p>It is indeed fair to say that Shakspere must
have drunk a bitter cup in his life as an actor.
It is true that that calling is apt to be more
humiliating than another to a man's self-respect,
if his judgment remain sane and
sensitive. We have the expression of it all in
the Sonnets:<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Alas! 'tis true, I have gone here and there,</span>
<span class="i0">And made myself a motley to the view,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear</i>,</span>
<span class="i0"><i>Made old offences of affections new</i>."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is impossible to put into fewer and fuller
words the story, many a year long, of sordid
compulsion laid on an artistic nature to turn
its own inner life into matter for the stage. But
he who can read Shakspere might be expected
to divine that it needed, among other things,
even some such discipline as that to give his
spirit its strange universality of outlook. And
he who could esteem both Shakspere and Mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>taigne
might have been expected to note how
they drew together at that very point of the final
retirement, the dramatic caterer finally winning,
out of his earnings, the peace and self-possession
that the essayist had inherited without toil. He
must, one thinks, have repeated to himself Montaigne's
very words<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>: "My design is to pass
quietly, and not laboriously, what remains to
me of life; there is nothing for which I am
minded to make a strain: not knowledge, of
whatever great price it be." And when he at
length took himself away to the quiet village of
his birth, it could hardly be that he had not
in mind those words of the essay<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> on
<span class="smcap">Solitude</span>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We should reserve a storehouse for ourselves ...
altogether ours, and wholly free, wherein we may hoard
up and establish our true liberty, the principal retreat
and solitariness, wherein we must go alone to ourselves....
We have lived long enough for others, live we
the remainder of all life unto ourselves.... Shake
we off these violent hold-fasts which elsewhere
engage us, and estrange us from ourselves.
The greatest thing of the world is for a man
to know how to be his own. It is high time to shake

<p>In perfect keeping with all this movement
towards peace and contemplation, and in final
keeping, too, with the deeper doctrine of Montaigne,
is the musing philosophy which lights,
as with a wondrous sunset, the play which one
would fain believe the last of all. At the end,
as at the beginning, we find the poet working on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>a pre-existing basis, re-making an old play; and
at the end, as at the beginning, we find him picturing,
with an incomparable delicacy, new ideal
types of womanhood, who stand out with a
fugitive radiance from the surroundings of mere
humanity; but over all alike, in the <span class="smcap">Tempest</span>,
there is the fusing spell of philosophic reverie.
Years before, in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, he had dramatically
caught the force of Montaigne's frequent
thought that daylight life might be taken as a
nightmare, and the dream life as the real. It
was the kind of thought to recur to the dramatist
above all men, even were it not pressed upon him
by the essayist's reiterations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Those which have compared our life unto a dream,
have happily had more reason so to do than they were
aware. When we dream, our soul liveth, worketh, and
exerciseth all her faculties, even and as much as when it
waketh.... We wake sleeping, and sleep waking.
In my sleep I see not so clear, yet can I never find my
waking clear enough, or without dimness.... Why
make we not a doubt whether our thinking and our
working be another dreaming, and our waking some
kind of sleeping?"<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>"Let me think of building castles in Spain, my
imagination will forge me commodities and afford means
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>and delights wherewith my mind is really tickled
and essentially gladded. How often do we pester
our spirits with anger or sadness by such shadows, and
entangle ourselves into fantastical passions which alter
both our mind and body?... Enquire of yourself,
where is the object of this alteration? Is there
anything but us in nature, except subsisting nullity?
over whom it hath any power?... Aristodemus,
king of the Messenians, killed himself upon a conceit he
took of some ill presage by I know not what howling
of dogs.... It is the right way to prize one's life at
the right worth of it, to forego it for a dream."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>"... Our reasons do often anticipate the effect
and have the extension of their jurisdiction so infinite,
that they judge and exercise themselves in inanity, and
to a not being. Besides the flexibility of our invention,
to frame reasons unto all manner of dreams; our
imagination is likewise found easy to receive impressions
from falsehood, by very frivolous appearances."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p></div>

<p>Again and again does the essayist return to this
note of mysticism, so distinct from the daylight
practicality of his normal utterance. And it
was surely with these musings in his mind that
the poet makes Prospero pronounce upon the
phantasmagoria that the spirits have performed
at his behest. We know, indeed, that the speech
proceeds upon a reminiscence of four lines in the
Earl of Stirling's <span class="smcap">Darius</span> (1604), lines in them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>selves
very tolerable, alike in cadence and
sonority, but destined to be remembered by
reason of the way in which the master, casting
them into his all-transmuting alembic, has
remade them in the fine gold of his subtler
measure. The Earl's lines run:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Let greatness of her glassy scepters vaunt;</span>
<span class="i1">Not scepters, no, but reeds, soon bruised, soon broken;</span>
<span class="i0">And let this worldly pomp our wits enchant;</span>
<span class="i1">All fades, and scarcely leaves behind a token.</span>
<span class="i0">Those golden palaces, those gorgeous halls,</span>
<span class="i1">With furniture superfluously fair;</span>
<span class="i0">Those stately courts, those sky-encountering walls,</span>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Evanish all like vapours in the air."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The sonorities of the rhymed verse seem to have
vibrated in the poet's brain amid the memories
of the prose which had suggested to him so
much; and the verse and prose alike are raised
to an immortal movement in the great lines of
Prospero:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"These our actors,</span>
<span class="i0">As I foretold you, are all spirits, and</span>
<span class="i0">Are melted into air, into thin air.</span>
<span class="i0">And like the baseless fabric of this vision,</span>
<span class="i0">The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,</span>
<span class="i0">The solemn temples, the great globe itself,</span>
<span class="i0">Yea, all which it inherits, shall dissolve</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, like this unsubstantial pageant faded,</span>
<span class="i0">Leave not a wrack behind. <i>We are such stuff</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As dreams are made on</i>, and our little life</span>
<span class="i0">Is rounded with a sleep."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the face of that vast philosophy, it seems an
irrelevance to reason, as some do, that in the
earlier scene in which Gonzalo expounds his
Utopia of incivilisation, Shakspere so arranges
the dialogue as to express his own ridicule of the
conception. The interlocutors, it will be
remembered, are Sebastian and Antonio, two of
the villains of the piece, and Alonso, the
wrecked usurper. The kind Gonzalo talks of
the ideal community to distract Alonso's
troubled thoughts; Sebastian and Antonio jeer
at him; and Alonso finally cries, "Pr'ythee, no
more, thou dost talk nothing to me." Herr
Gervinus is quite sure that this was meant to
state Shakspere's prophetic derision for all
communisms and socialisms and peace congresses,
Shakspere being the fore-ordained
oracle of the political gospel of his German commentators,
on the principle of "Gott mit uns."
And it may well have been that Shakspere,
looking on the society of his age, had no faith in
any Utopia, and that he humorously put what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
he felt to be a valid criticism of Montaigne's in
the mouth of a surly rascal&mdash;he has done as much
elsewhere. But he was surely the last man to
have missed seeing that Montaigne's Utopia was
no more Montaigne's personal political counsel
to his age than <span class="smcap">As You Like It</span> was his own;
and, as regards the main purpose of Montaigne's
essay, which was to show that civilisation was no
unmixed gain as contrasted with some forms of
barbarism, the author of <span class="smcap">Cymbeline</span> was hardly
the man to repugn it, even if he amused himself
by putting forward Caliban<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> as the real "cannibal,"
in contrast to Montaigne's. He had given
his impression of certain aspects of civilisation
in <span class="smcap">Hamlet</span>, <span class="smcap">Measure for Measure</span>, and <span class="smcap">King
Lear</span>. As his closing plays show, however, he
had reached the knowledge that for the general
as for the private wrong, the sane man must
cease to cherish indignation. That teaching,
which he could not didactically impose, for such
a world as his, on the old tragedy of revenge
which he recoloured with Montaigne's thought,
he found didactically enough set down in the
essay on Diversion:<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>"Revenge is a sweet pleasing passion, of a great
and natural impression: I perceive it well, albeit I have
made no trial of it. To divert of late a young prince
from it, I told him not he was to offer the one side of
his cheek to him who had struck him on the other in
regard of charity; nor displayed I unto him the tragical
events poesy bestoweth upon that passion. There I
left him and strove to make him taste the beauty of a
contrary image; the honour, the favour, and the goodwill
he should acquire by gentleness and goodness; I
diverted him to ambition."</p></div>

<p>And now it is didactically uttered by the wronged
magician in the drama:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,</span>
<span class="i0">Yet with my nobler reason, 'gainst my fury</span>
<span class="i0">Do I take part; the rarer action is</span>
<span class="i0">In virtue than in vengeance...."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>The principle now pervades the whole of Prospero's
society; even the cursed and cursing
Caliban is recognised<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> as a necessary member of
it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i01">"We cannot miss him; he does make our fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Fetch in our wood; and serves in offices</span>
<span class="i0">That profit us."</span>
</div>
</div>


<p>It is surely not unwarrantable to pronounce,
then, finally, that the poet who thus watchfully
lit his action from the two sides of passion and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>sympathy was in the end at one with his "guide,
philosopher, and friend," who in that time of
universal strife and separateness could of his
own accord renew the spirit of Socrates, and
say:<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> "I esteem all men my compatriots, and
embrace a Pole even as a Frenchman, subordinating
this national tie to the common and
universal." Here, too, was not Montaigne the
first of the moderns?</p>

and others of the above parallels, which I had not observed when writing
on the subject in 1883. In view of some other parallels and clues drawn
by him, our agreements leave me a little uneasy. He decides, for instance
(p. 93) that Hamlet's phrase "foul as Vulcan's stithy" is a "sly thrust at
Florio" who in his preface calls himself "Montaigne's Vulcan"; that the
Queen's phrase "thunders in the index" is a reference to "the Index of the
Holy See and its thunders"; and that Hamlet's lines "Why let the stricken
deer go weep" are clearly a satire against Montaigne, "who fights shy of
action." Mr. Feis's book contains so many propositions of this order that
it is difficult to feel sure that he is ever judicious. Still, I find myself in
agreement with him on some four or five points of textual coincidence in
the two authors.</p></div>

Montaigne observes that "drunkenness amongst others appeareth to me a
gross and brutish vice," that "the worst estate of man is where he loseth
the knowledge and government of himself," and that "the grossest and
rudest nation that liveth amongst us at this day, is only that which keepeth
it in credit." The reference is to Germany: but Shakspere in <i>Othello</i> (Act
II, Sc. 3) makes Iago pronounce the English harder drinkers than either
the Danes or the Hollanders; and the lines:
</p>

no weight whatever. He goes so far as to assume that the speech of Prospero
in which Shakspere transmutes four lines of the Earl of Stirling's
<i>Darius</i> must have been written immediately after the publication of that
work. The argument is (1) that Shakspere must have seen <i>Darius</i> when it
came out, and (2) that he would imitate the passage then or never.</p></div>

learned is that made in the <i>Critital Observations on Shakspere</i> (1746) of the
Rev. John Upton, a man of great erudition and much random acuteness (shown
particularly in bold attempts to excise interpolations from the Gospels), but
as devoid of the higher critical wisdom as was Bentley, whom he congenially
criticised. To a reader of to-day, his arguments from Shakspere's diction

against the strictures of M. Stapfer, who, after recognising the general pertinence
of his remarks, proceeds to say (<i>Shakspere and Classical Antiquity</i>,
Eng. trans, p. 83) that Farmer "fell into the egregious folly of speaking in a
strain of impertinent conceit: it is as if the little man for little he must
assuredly have been&mdash;was eaten up with vanity." This is in its way as unjust
as the abuse of Knight. M. Stapfer has misunderstood Farmer's tone,
which is one of banter against, not Shakspere, but those critics who blunderingly
ascribed to him a wide and close knowledge of the classics.
Towards Shakspere, Farmer was admiringly appreciative&mdash;and in the preface
to the second edition of his essay he wrote: "Shakspere wanted not
the stilts of languages to raise him above all other men."</p></div>

frame an inductive notion of Shakspere, even when rejecting good evidence
and proceeding on deductive lines; that in the works of Professor Dowden
on Shakspere there is always an effort towards a judicial method, though
he refuses to take some of the most necessary steps; and that the work of
Mr. Appleton Morgan, President of the New York Shakspere Society,
entitled <i>Shakspere in Fact and Criticism</i> (New York, 1888), is certainly not
open to the criticism I have passed. Mr. Morgan's essentially rationalistic
attitude is indicated in a sentence of his preface: "My own idea has been
that William Shakspere was a man of like passions with ourselves, whose
moods and veins were influenced, just as are ours, by his surroundings, employments,
vocations ... and that, great as he was, and oceanic as
was his genius, we can read him all the better because he was, after all, a
man...." In recognising the good sense of Mr. Morgan's general
attitude, I must not be understood to endorse his rejection of the "metrical
tests" of Mr. Fleay and other English critics. These seem to me to be about
the most important English contribution to the scientific comprehension of
Shakspere. On the other hand, it may be said that the naturalistic conception
of Shakspere as an organism in an environment was first closely
approached in the present century by French critics, as Guizot and Chasles
(Taine's picture of the Elizabethan theatre, adopted by Green, having been
founded on a study by Chasles); that the naturalistic comprehension of
<i>Hamlet</i>, as an incoherent whole resulting from the putting of new cloth
into an old garment, was first reached by the German R&uuml;melin (<i>Shakspere
Studien</i>); and that the structural anomalies of <i>Hamlet</i> as an acting play
were first clearly put by the German Benedix (<i>Die Shakspereomanie</i>) these
two critics thus making amends for much vain discussion of <i>Hamlet</i> by
their countrymen before and since; while the naturalistic conception of the
man Shakspere is being best developed at present in America. The admirable
work of Messrs. Clarke and Wright and Fleay in the analysis of the
text and the revelation of its non-Shaksperean elements, seems to make
little impression on English culture; while such a luminous manual as Mr.
Barrett Wendell's <i>William Shakspere: a Study in Elizabethan Literature</i>
(New York, 1894), with its freshness of outlook and appreciation, points to
decided progress in rational Shakspere-study in the States, though, like the
<i>Shakspere Primer</i> of Professor Dowden, it is not consistently scientific
throughout.</p></div>

head. In his <i>Shakspere in Fact and Criticism</i>, already cited, he writes (p.
316): "I find him ... living and dying so utterly unsuspicious that he
had done anything of which his children might care to hear, that he never
even troubled himself to preserve the manuscript of or the literary property
in a single one of the plays which had raised him to affluence." As I have
already pointed out, there is no reason to suppose that Shakspere could
retain the ownership of his plays any more than did the other writers who
supplied his theatre. They belonged to the partnership. Besides, he could
not possibly have published as <i>his</i> the existing mass, so largely made up of
other men's work. His fellow-players did so without scruple after his
death, being simply bent on making money.</p></div>

date of the publication of the Sonnets. As Mr. Minto argues, "the only
sonnet of really indisputable date is the 107th, containing the reference to
the death of Elizabeth" (<i>Characteristics</i>, as cited, p. 220). As the first 126
sonnets make a series, it is reasonable to take those remaining as of later

<p>Although the title of this book defines its scope, it
does not indicate its main purpose. That is to show
that the Celtic race has been misrepresented by a number
of historians, from Mommsen to Froude, as incapable
of self-government; and to prove, by inference,
its fitness for Home Rule.... The major argument is
based by Mommsen and his school on the assumption of
permanent distinctions among races; and therefore Mr.
Robertson applies himself, with a large measure of success,
to the task of showing that the theory of innate
persistent qualities marking off one people from another
has no ethnological justification.... Mr. Robertson
is able to make short and easy work of the loose writing
which sums up those (imaginary) characters in epithet
or epigram.... Mr. Robertson's lively style and
happy allusiveness keep the reader interested to the
end...</p>

<h4><b>PSEUDO-PHILOSOPHY</b></h4>
<h4><i>AT THE END OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.</i></h4>

<h5>By <span class="smcap">Hugh Mortimer Cecil</span>.</h5>

<h4><b>PRESS OPINIONS.</b></h4>
<p><i>The Sun</i>, <span class="smcap">March</span> 31, 1897:</p>
<p>The author of "Pseudo-Philosophy" handles his
weapons well, and seems to us in many instances to
occupy positions which, with our present human intelligence,
are almost unassailable. On the other hand, of
course, champions of orthodoxy, as a rule, frankly
admit that some of their tenets and the justice of
certain aspects of the divine policy cannot be comprehended
by the natural man. But Mr. Cecil's strong
feelings occasionally carry him too far, as when in the
preface he seems to use "religious obscurantism" as a
synonym for religion generally. The former may have
been opposed to social progress, as he says. To contend
that the same charge will stand against the latter
is only to ignore the fact, if not indeed the law, that
the great social awakenings have almost invariably followed
hard upon the great religious revivals.
